MRS BRACEGIRDLE,Yeah 
PIPPIN,"Not too happy at all, Merry.           "
SAM,"I wonder if people will ever say,      ""Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.""      And they'll say,      ""Yes! That's one of my favourite stories.""      ""Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? ""      ""Yes, my boy. ,The most famousest of Hobbits.      And that's saying a lot."",     "

PIPPIN,I don't believe it.           
ELROND,There is nothing for you here only death. 
FRODO,Who are you ? 
SAM,"But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass.      A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.      Those were the stories      that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small      to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.           "
FREDA,Mama! 
PIPPIN,"Home is behind, The world ahead, ,  And     there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night    ,      Until the stars are all alight. ,  Mist and shadow     cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall , 'fade.      "

GANDALF,Faramir tell me everything.  Tell me all you know.   
SAM,Ready to do what?  
GANDALF,Oh not at all!       
PIPPIN,"A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.    ,The city was burning. "
FRODO,Speak friend... and enter.  What's the elvish word for     friend ? 
ARAGORN,I will go!

THEODEN,We shall have peace'. We shall have peace when you answer for the     burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg' are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows' we shall have peace!  
CROWD,For Gondor!  
SAM,It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?

MERRY, Are you mad? We'll be caught.       
FRODO,    Gimli!  
GANDALF,Good gracious me!       
PIPPIN,  Where are they?     
SAM,What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we?   
FRODO,"Long ago, when there was a King. "
EOMER,  Nooooooo!  Noooooo!      
VOICE,I know you're in there!       
EOMER,"I would cut off your head, Dwarf......if it stood but a little higherfrom the ground. "
GOLLUM,"Up, up, up the stairs we go.  And then it's into the tunnel. "
EOWYN,"Just to the encampment.  It's tradition for the women of the court to     farewell the men.  ,         The men have found their captain.  They will follow you into battle.  Even     to death.  You have given us hope.  "
GANDALF,"     No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here.  If in doubt, Meriadoc,     always follow your nose. "
GANDALF,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.           
ARAGORN,She stays because she still has hope. 
PIPPIN,What are you doing?           
SAM,"    Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!  "
SAM,Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something. 
FRODO,They've come.           
BILBO,"It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?       "
SOLDIER,We need more rubble! 
THEODEN,    CHAAAAARGE!  
SAM,She's an elf! 
GANDALF,Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if     that does not shatter them and I'm allowed a little peace from foolish     questions I will try to find the opening words. 
SAM,Can't you hear yourself?Don't you know who you sound like?  
SAM,"  Take mine. ,  There's a few drops left.      "
SOLDIER, Pull! 
SANDYMAN,Children's stories that's all that is.  You're beginning to sound     like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was! 
GANDALF,"The board is set, the pieces are moving. "
EOMER,"Theoden no longer recognizesfriend from foe. Not even his own kin. ,Saruman has poisoned the mindof the king......and claimed lordship over these lands.    My company are those loyal to Rohan.And for that, we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there, they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked.And everywhere, his spiesslip past our nets. "
MERRY,You just said something...Treeish. 
ARAGORN,Arwen.... 
ELROND,Whether by the swordor the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfortfor you......no comfort to ease the painof his passing.He will come to death......an image of the splendorof the kings of Men......in glory undimmed beforethe breaking of the world.

SAM, Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! 
PIPPIN,    The eagles! The eagles are coming!

ARAGORN,Why have you come? 
GRISHNAKH,They look tasty. 
SAM,D'you hear that!  Rivendell! We're going to see the     elves! 
GOLLUM," Look, what's this?  ,  Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it! ,He took it! ,  I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's     not looking. "
TREEBEARD,Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.       
GRIMA,"Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy     for the king......to lose his only son and heir. "

FRODO,"I can feel his blade.  ,      "
GOLLUM,The Black Gate of Mordor. 
ARAGORN,Gimli!

BOROMIR," This isn't     a mine, it's a tomb "
MERRY,A     gathering of what? 
ARAGORN,Gondor will answer. 
FRODO,    I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The     lights on the party tree. 
SHARKU,He's......dead.He took a little tumble off the cliff. 
GOLLUM,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! ,     Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! "
EOWYN,What other duty would you have me do my lord? 
MERRY,ls it much further? 
FRODO,Pippin! 
FRODO,Don't touch me! 
LEGOLAS,He was twitching.           
MERRY,I know you've run out. You smoke too much Pippin. 
MERRY,Get him!  
GOLLUM,Kill them both.           
FRODO,"We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is     Samwise Gamgee. "
DENETHOR,    Farewell Peregrin son of Paladin. 
DENETHOR,    Aaaaaahhhh!  
EOWYN,"I'm sorry. Please, eat. "
PIPPIN,This was yours?   
FRODO,How far to the nearest crossing ? 
FRODO,"Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.  "
KING OF THE DEAD,We fight!  
SAM,Even you couldn't say no to that.  
GIMLI,My lady. 
THEODEN,"  Sound the charge.  Take them head-on. Chaaarge! ,     "
GANDALF,"Spies of Saruman.  The passage south is being watched    ,  We must take the     Pass of Caradhras  "
GIMLI,Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they     have none now in death.  
ORC,    This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. 
FRODO,"Oh no you dont , Go on     "
ARAGORN,I do not fear death! 
EOWYN,"They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving     through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.     "
STRIDER,Hurry! 
FRODO,"  Give it to me! ,  Give me the Ring Sam.    ,  Sam!  Give me the Ring.    ,  You must understand.  The Ring is my burden.  It will destroy you Sam.      "
GOLLUM,Master broke his promise.           
GANDALF,...somewhere in the wilderness.           
STRIDER,It may help to slow the poison.  Hurry! 
THEODEN,     Ten thousand? 
DENETHOR,Faramir! Say not that he has fallen.  
ELROND,"The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and     you who travel with him, , no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will    , Farewell. Hold to     your purpose and may the blessings of elves , and men ,,     and all free folk , go with     you.  "
GOLLUM,Yes. 
THEODEN,Shore up the door!       
GIMLI,So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words     we can also understand! 
MADRIL,We can't hold them.  The city is lost. 
GOLLUM,Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own. 
TREEBEARD,"Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom.      Last march......of the Ents.       "
GANDALF,Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at     risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's counsel.     
SAM,  That's for Frodo!     
GANDALF,"    So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.  "
ARAGORN,The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.   
FRODO,"    No Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the     touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's' there's nothing, no veil     between me and the wheel of fire. ,I can see him with my waking eyes!  "
GANDALF,It's Gollum 
SOLDIER,Brace the gate!       
GANDALF,"They will be. ,     You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the     black ships. ,     Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for     Minas Tirith , and I     wont be going alone. "
ARAGORN,'-ethelithon.

SMEAGOL,Not listening. I'm not listening. 
FRODO,Sam.  
ELROND,Tangado haid!  
ARAGORN,    You may go no further.  
GIMLI,Mind your aim. 
GOLLUM,So bright.So beautiful. 
SARUMAN,Swear it.
PIPPIN,He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me! 
EOMER,Orcs are roaming freelyacross our lands.Unchecked. Unchallenged.Killing at will.Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman
SHAGRAT,    Then he'll wish he'd never been born. 
GANDALF,Well that should please him.  
THEODEN,Victory! We have victory!           
PIPPIN,What does that mean? What's wrong?  He looks at Gandalf. 
GRIMA,"But, my lord, there is no such force.  "
SMEAGOL,"Gollum' Gollum' Gollum' , and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone.  "
GIMLI,    Aye! I could do that. 
THEODEN,Get the wounded on horses.The wolves of lsengard will return.Leave the dead. 
BILBO,My dear Gandalf!  
GRISHNAKH,Go on.Call for help. Squeal.No one's going to save you now.  
SAM,Haven't you had any sleep Mr Frodo?  
SMEAGOL,Leave now and never come back.  
ARAGORN,Hado i philinn! 
SAM,"Let me see.Oh, yes. Lovely.Lembas bread. And look!More lembas bread. "
SAM,"  I thought I'd lost you.  So I took it, only for safekeeping.      "
EOWYN,"    Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.  "
SMEAGOL,Master looks after us now.We don't need you. 
STRIDER,He's passing into the Shadow world.  He'll soon become a wraith     like them.  
DENETHOR,"    NOOOOOO, you will not take my son from me!  "
SARUMAN, the dwarves delved too greadily     and too deep 
GANDALF,"      They have taken the Bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums    ,     Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark.    , We cannot get out. They are     coming. "
EOWYN,"I made some stew.It isn't much, but it's hot.  "
ARAGORN,Hannon le. 
GANDALF,"I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond for the Black Speech     of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West , The Ring is altogether     evil  "
GANDALF,And what about very old friends?       
FRODO,You know the way to Mordor? 
SAM,I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. 
GOLLUM,We wants it.We needs it.Must have the precious.They stole it from us.Sneaky little Hobbitses.Wicked. Tricksy. False. 
GOLLUM,You don't have any friends.Nobody likes you. 
GANDALF,"There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He     thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre.     Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of     Rohan. , He will need     you before the end,    Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. ,The defenses , to hold.  "
MERRY,Three-foot-eight.You did something. 
THEODEN,"What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a     thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an     end......as to be worthy of remembrance. "
ARWEN,Some things are certain. 
STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you. "
SAM,"It's always dark here.  ,  It's gone!     , The elven bread!     "
THEODEN,"Let this be the hour      when we draw swords together. ,     "
GIMLI,It's one of their wee belts. 
THEODEN,Our people are safe.We have paid for it with many lives. 
GANDALF,"So am I dear boy. , So am I. "
GOLLUM,No. 
GANDALF,"We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for     forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.    , and there are     road turns east to Mordor. "
GOLLUM,"Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.  Smeagol hates nasty elf bread.      "
CAPTAIN,Come on! 
MERRY,You! 
GIMLI,Gandalf. 
SOLDIER,Hold them!       
THEODEN,Come. 
THEODEN,"This is not a defeat. We will return.,We will return. "
PIPPIN,"It's the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf. "
SMEAGOL,"But the fat Hobbit, he knows.      Eyes always watching.           "
FRODO,Gandalf! 
GANDALF,"  White shores and beyond,  a far green country under a swift sunrise.      "
ARAGORN,You fell. 
PIPPIN, Nothing's     happening 
IROLAS,Quick! Hurry!  
FARAMIR,My lord Osgiliath is over run.   
FRODO," Go     on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. "
GANDALF,There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.      Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested 
MERRY,What do you suppose that means ? 
MERRY, Pippin! 
GIMLI,What kind of army would linger in such a place?  
GAMLING,Fall back! Fall back!       
ARWEN,' i vethed... n' i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han b'd l'n. 
PIPPIN,lt could well be dangerous! 
SOLDIERS,"Keep going.  It's the Nazgul.  Take cover my lord.     ,     It's coming.  "
GOLLUM," You'll see. Oh yes, you     will see. "
GIMLI,Ach! 
STRIDER,Tis the Lady of L'thien. The Elf Maiden who gave her love     to Beren ... a mortal 
EOWYN,     The City has fallen silent.  There is no warmth left in the sun.       
TREEBEARD,"War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig.      But you must understand, young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old      Entish... ,...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.,     "
GANDALF,"Breathe the free air again, my friend. "
BOROMIR,For Gondor! 
PIPPIN,Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from     many foes. 
SAM,"    Let him go, you filth! Let him go!  "
LEGOLAS,"The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead , and the dead keep it. The     way is shut.  "
THEODEN,"    Ride now, ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world's ending! DEATH! "
GRIMA,"Theoden will not stay at Edoras.It's vulnerable. He knows this.,He will expect an attack on the city.,They will flee to Helm's Deep......the great fortress of Rohan.,It is a dangerous road to takethrough the mountains.,They will be slow.,They will have women and childrenwith them.  "
MERRY AND PIPPIN,Frodo! Frodo! 
ARAGORN,It's the beards.  
GOTHMOG," Faster!  ,      Draw swords.   "
SAM,"I don't usually hold with foreign food.....but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad. "
ARAGORN,One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk. 
FRODO,Sam!   
THEODEN,"  Make safe the city.,     "
FRODO, No!  
THEODEN,Higher!       
FRODO,There's no promise you can makethat I can trust. 
PIPPIN,"I just want to look at it, just one more time. "
GOTHMOG,"    Form ranks you maggots. Form ranks. Pikes in front, archers behind.     "
MERRY,"See? I fooled you too.Don't worry about me, Pippin. "
ELROND,Boromir! 
FRODO,Gandalf! 
EOMER,He's alive.
SMEAGOL, Cruel Men hurts us. Master     tricksed us. 
GALADRIEL,For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the     fortunes of all. 
SHAGRAT,"  It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.      "
SAM,  But he's a liar!  He's poisoned     you against me.   
ARAGORN,Legolas! Run!  
ARAGORN,I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey 
EOMER,"You know as little of war as that Hobbit.   When the fear takes him    , and the blood and the     screams and the horror of battle take hold.  Do you think he would stand and     fight?  He would flee.  And he would be right to do so.     ,  War is the     province of men Eowyn.   "
GANDALF,There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.     
ARAGORN,"Ride out with me. ,Ride out and meet them.,     "
GOTHMOG,What are you doing you useless scum?  
ELROND, You have     only one choice.  The Ring must be destroyed.  
FARAMIR,Nazgul!             
SAM,"That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.           "
SAM,"    Rosie Cotton dancing. ,     She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have     been her. , It would've been her.  "
HAMA,I'm not sure.

ARAGORN, I summon you to     fulfil your oath!  
FRODO,Real Elvish rope. 
GANDALF,Aragorn is right.  We cannot use it 
FRODO,    The Ring is mine! 
FRODO,A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.         
SAM,Mr Frodo ? 
THEODEN,"  You already did.  Eowyn, my body is broken.  You have to let me go.      "
PIPPIN,They called us out to fight.  
GOLLUM,"Sshh, quiet, mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now.      "
PIPPIN,"Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next? "
THEODEN,"I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill.  "
WOMAN,He's alive!

PIPPIN,I've always been taller than you. 
MERRY,My lady!  
MERRY,All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left     behind.  
ARAGORN,You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you.     His men will return and fight for their king. 
FARAMIR,"The enemy? ,His sense of duty was no lessthan yours, I deem.,You wonder what his name is......where he came from.,And if he was really evil at heart.,What lies or threats led himon this long march from home.,If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace.,War will make corpses of us all.,Bind their hands."
FRODO,Its so light! 
MERRY,"Share it? ,No. No. ,Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. ,Could be a distant relative.           "
GANDALF,"Your father loves you Faramir.  ,  He will remember it before the end.   "
ARAGORN,Do not look down.  
GOLLUM,"Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol ever done to him?      Master?  ,Master carries a heavy     burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.  Fat one cannot know.  ,  He wants it.  He needs     it.  Smeagol sees it in his eye.  , Very soon he will ask you for it.  You     will see.   The fat one will take it from you!       "
MERRY,Pippin!  
TREEBEARD,They had voices of their own.       
GANDALF,Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that     still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will     strike.  
SOLDIER,None have come my lord.   
FRODO,I amar prestar aen     Han mathon ne nen     Han mathon ne chae     A han noston ned gwilith     Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it.
EOWYN,"  No, no.  I'm going to save you.      "
THEODEN,"Ach, don't listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you. "
PIPPIN,"    Gandalf! , Where's     Gandalf? , GANDALF!     "
SAM,Here. 
SAM,"    No! , Don't you let go! Don't let go! Reeeaaach!     "
GANDALF,"And I must follow if I can. , The road goes     ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road     has gone, and I must follow if I can.       "
FARAMIR,Who's covering the river to the north? 
GANDALF,"I am Saruman.Or rather, Sarumanas he should have been. "
GANDALF,"and the Ring ? , You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it     too.  You must be careful now.  Evil will be drawn to you from     outside the Fellowship and I fear from within.  "
FRODO,"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.       "
SOLDIER,"Make way for the King!  Make way, the King is here "
GOLLUM,"lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.           "
FARAMIR,May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.           
GAMLING,There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far.      The Uruk-hai are too many.           
GANDALF,So you mean to go through with your plan then?       
THEODEN,For death and glory.           
GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way "
GIMLI,Dwarf doors are invisible when closed  
BILBO,"Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are     made. , Oh, thank you.       "
DENETHOR,"But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. "
ROSIE,    Goodnight lads.  
GRIMA,Too much.You are banished forthwithfrom the kingdom of Rohan......and all its domainsunder pain of death.
SAM,What do we do now ? 
ORC,"  To the gate you slugs, now move it! ,  Don't you know we're at war?      "
GANDALF,Through fire.....and water.
GANDALF,"Did he?Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good."
SAM,"Strider! , Get off him!     "
GANDALF, Do we know that? 
GOLLUM,"All dead. All rotten.Elves and Men and Orcses.A great battle long ago.Dead Marshes.Yes. Yes, that is their name.This way.Don't follow the lights. "
GOLLUM,    AAAAAHH
