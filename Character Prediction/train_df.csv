PIPPIN,"Well, that's good news. "
PIPPIN,    Frodo. 
ARAGORN," A      Eruch'n, '-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! ,     "

GANDALF, That Frodo is alive.     Yes' yes he's alive.  
SOLDIER,"Open the gate, quick!  "
PIPPIN,    NO! Aaahhh 
THEODEN,"I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep. "
GIMLI,"  Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?      "
PIPPIN,"I don't know, I can't help it. "
GALADRIEL,You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-d'm 
TREEBEARD,I don't remember now.
BOROMIR,"No. My place is here with     my people. ,Not in Rivendell. "
FARAMIR,That is not my intent. 
PIPPIN,Merry! Merry? Wake up 
FRODO,"For within these rings was bound the strength and will     to govern each race. ,     But they were all of them deceived. ,For another ring was made. , In the land of Mordor, ,in the fires of Mount Doom (, the dark Lord Sauron forged in     secret a master Ring ,to control all others and into this Ring he poured     all his cruelty, his malice , and his will to     dominate all life. , One Ring to rule them all.  "
ARAGORN,She is sailing to the Undying Landswith all that is left of her kin. 
THEODEN,Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to     ours? What do we owe Gondor? 
SAM,I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.    
PIPPIN,Alive? 
THEODEN, Ride! Ride now to Gondor. 
ARAGORN,Gimli!Lower your axe. 
GOLLUM,It's the only way. Go in' or go back.  
SARUMAN,"So Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.  And     if that fails, where then will you go ? "
SAM,"Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed      Gollum.    "
FARAMIR,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.     ,     If I should return, think better of me father.  "
BOROMIR, Gondor. 
ARWEN,May the grace of the Valarprotect you.  
ARAGORN,You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.      They still defend it. They have died defending it.           
ORC,I'm going to rip outyour filthy little innards! 
ARAGORN,Get them out of here! 
PIPPIN,Merry?  
EOWYN,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting. "
FRODO,Faramir! You must let me go!       
BILBO,And there always will be.       
IROLAS,It is as the Lord Denethor predicted!  Long has he foreseen this doom!      
GOLLUM,Master! 
GANDALF,You shall not pass! 
STRIDER,This was the great watch tower of Amon    
FRODO,"He's up to something. , All right then,     keep your secrets! "
LEGOLAS,You would die before your stroke fell. 
FRODO,Who is     she ? This woman you sing of ?  
MERRY,Pippin!  
FRODO,For what?  
MERRY,That was good! 
FRODO,Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk. 
GRIMBOLD, I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.   
GANDALF,"This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.    ,All     the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet     him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.    , You must     fight. "
ARAGORN,Is there no other way for the women      and children to get out of the caves?     
FRODO,"The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep     into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. , And there it consumed him. "
PIPPIN,I think we are 
GAFFER,"      Young Mr Frodo here, he's cracking! "
GANDALF,You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?     
GANDALF,"Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. "
PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it?  
FRODO," Sam, no!   "
ARAGORN,We are no spies.We track a party of Uruk-haiwestward across the plain.They have taken two of our friendscaptive. 
MERRY,My tomato's burst! 
GAMLING,He leaves because there is no hope. 
CROWD,Speech Bilbo  
MERRY,"He doesn't look too happy, does he?           "
FRODO,What about you?  
LEGOLAS,They may yet be alive.
GANDALF,Theoden......son of Thengel......too long have you sat in     the Shadows. 
BOROMIR,Leaves more time for drinking!     Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!     
GANDALF,"Frodo, come and help an old man ,How's your shoulder? "
FRODO,We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my     side. 
GANDALF,"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now.     War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged     with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons. "
MERRY,Aaagh!It's got my leg! 
GALADRIEL,Build     me an army worthy of Mordor 
FRODO,Its wonderful to see you Gandalf. 
ORC,We don't have enough fuelto feed the fires.
THEODEN,"A great host, you say? "
EOWYN,"My uncle told me a strange thing.He said that you rode to warwith Thengel, my grandfather.But he must be mistaken. "
SOLDIER,Watch out!  
FRODO,"Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.,     "
FRODO,Here. 
THEODEN,"They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.    ,Saruman's     hordes will pillage and burn.    We've seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these     walls......we will outlast them. "
TREEBEARD,Saruman. A wizard should know better!      
ELROND,"Arwen.,There is nothing for you here......only death. "
GOLLUM,(strokes his own palm)Our precious. 
GANDALF,This is no place for a Hobbit!  
GIMLI,I've heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob!  
SARUMAN,If the wall is breachedHelm's Deep will fall. 
GANDALF,A thing is about to happen that has nothappened since the Elder Days.The Ents are going to wake up.....and find that they are strong. 
PIPPIN,But we have the white wizard.  That's got to count for something.      
THEODEN,And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as     you. The old alliances are dead. 
MERRY,"My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for    , and many who love you. I     know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in     hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds'but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again. "
URUK-HAI,I'm starving.We ain't had nothing but maggoty breadfor three stinking days. 
BOROMIR,What? 
MERRY,Help! Gandalf help!  
ARWEN,"I've been looking for you for two days. , There are five wraiths behind you,     where the other four are I do not know "
SAM,"Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you?      He was trying to save you, see?           "
ARAGORN,We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor. 
ARWEN,He's not going to last.  We must get him to my father.  
FRODO,Nothing 
FRODO,"We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.  "
ARAGORN,"What do you fear, my lady? "
GIMLI,     oh! 
ARAGORN,"You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death!    , What say you?  "
ARAGORN,"Gimli, where is the king?  "
SAM,    Samwise you fool. 
GANDALF,No word. Nothing. 
MERRY,He's remembered  
GANDALF,Indeed? 
ARAGORN,"Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.  ,  We have until dawn then we must ride.   "
ARAGORN,"Go on, go on ,Don't worry Sam.  He knows the way home. ,) "
SAM,"I don't want to keep it.  , I just want to help.   "
GIMLI,The sun is rising.           
THEODEN,"    Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank "
ARAGORN,Warg! We're under attack! 
SAM,    Take my hand.  
ARAGORN,    Hannon le. 
TREEBEARD,Bless my bark!  
GOLLUM,"To the Gate, to the Gate!To the Gate, the master says. Yes! "
THEODEN,He leaves because he must.   
MERRY,"He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I     would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get     him out. Now he's gone. , Just     like Frodo and Sam. "
SAM,You treacherous little toad!  
FRODO,"    ,And thus     it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring,     though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended.            Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find     ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.  "
FARAMIR,"Where does my allegiance lie if not here?  This is the city of the men     of N'menor.  I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory,     her wisdom. "
MERRY, Pippin! 
GIMLI,Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.Come on! 
GOTHMOG,Stay where you are! 
GANDALF,Frodo ? 
BOSON,Who are you to deny us passage?  
BILBO,"Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are.       "
GIMLI,"No, no , no "
GIMLI,I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!       
PIPPIN,He's alive!  
SAM, Anything ? 
GANDALF,Back to the gate! Hurry! 
GRIMA,What kind of devicecould bring down the wall?  
BILBO,"Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.  Welcome welcome.      Are all these children yours ? "
SAM,Mr. Frodo?           
FRODO,    Gollum? 
ARAGORN, That! was not so courteous! 
MERRY,That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he     walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ? 
FRODO,What do you want ? 
PIPPIN,"And you? You're coming with me? ,     Merry?  "
ARAGORN,We hear of trouble in Rohan.It goes ill with the king. 
GOLLUM,"We told him to go away.And away he goes, precious. ,Gone! Gone! Gone!Smeagol is free! "
THEODEN,Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate.And set a watch on the surround. 
PIPPIN,"Merry, don't! Don't drink it! "
ARAGORN,     Legolas!       
THEODEN,We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever     breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg! 
GOLLUM,Mustn't ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum. 
BILBO,"Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded     Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.        "
ORC,What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? 
MADRIL,Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.      By nightfall we will be overrun.           
SAM,"    It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North.     Something's drawn its gaze. "
MERRY,Outside  
FRODO,We're heading for the Prancing Pony. 
GOLLUM,For us. 
TREEBEARD,There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days. 
MERRY,Pippin! 
EOWYN,Gimli.? 
PIPPIN,Ahaha! 
SOLDIER,"Captain Faramir! ,We     found the third one. "
PIPPIN,What? 
FRODO, No! 
GOLLUM,We're not in decent places. 
SAM,"Mr Frodo!  , Get back     you!  Don't touch him.   "
BOROMIR,    Father! 
SAM,I hate this place. It's too quiet.There's been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days. 
BOROMIR,Sorry!  
GOLLUM,What did you say? 
PIPPIN,How far is Minas Tirith? 
FRODO, and proud of     it! Cheers Gaffer!   
ARAGORN,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.   
SAM,I'm on your side Mr Frodo 
PIPPIN, and some cabbages and those few     bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.  And the mushrooms the week     before. 
THEODEN,    Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! 
GOTHMOG,Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain.     Release the prisoners!  
PIPPIN,Than what? 
FRODO,You're late!       
SAM,I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to     kill us! 
FARAMIR,"Stay here. Keep out of sight. ,Take cover!           "
GOLLUM,"No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. ,Yes, master. Nice Hobbits.           "
BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother.  "
MERRY,hmmmhmmm 
THEODEN,I haven't seen my niece smilefor a long time.She was a girl when they broughther father back dead.Cut down by Orcs.She watched her mothersuccumb to grief. 
SOLDIER,    Take them down!  
GOLLUM,"And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She     always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. "
SAM,Mr Frodo?  What is it? 
LEGOLAS,"I feel something. , A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it's affecting me.  "
GIMLI,Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarrybut what bare rock can tell. 
ORC,Yes.
GANDALF,"Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their     secrets are forgotten! "
GIMLI,That road there where does that lead?   
SAM,You're hopeless. 
FRODO,I did. 
GANDALF,Until at last I threw downmy enemy......and smote his ruinupon the mountainside. 
GOLLUM,"No, no! Master! "
GOLLUM,"Too risky. Too risky. ,Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!    ,  "
FRODO,"What do you know about it?Nothing! ,I'm sorry, Sam. I don't knowwhy I said that. "
GIMLI,"Nothing, its just a whisp of cloud "
STRIDER,                    
SOLDIER,Sir?  King Theoden awaits you my lord.   
EOWYN,Where is she?The woman who gave you that jewel. 
GRIMA,How? How can fire undo stone? 
PIPPIN,"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from , ' from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me. "
THEODEN,"The fortress is taken. It is over.,     "
ARAGORN,"Pendraith! ,     "
ELROND,That future is almost gone. 
GOLLUM,Don't follow the lights. 
SOLDIER,My lord!  
LEGOLAS,"They have feelings, my friend.The Elves began it.Waking up the treesteaching them to speak. "
FRODO,Roast chicken?! 
FRODO,"    It's gone. , It's done. "
SARUMAN,Take back the lands they stole from you.Burn every village!
FRODO, Hit me!  Hit me Sam!  Start fighting!      
MERRY,"    Frodo! ,Frodo!     "
DEAGOL,Arrghh! 
LEGOLAS,They've run as if the very whipsof their masters were behind them. 
FARAMIR,"Take them to my father. ,Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.      ,A weapon that will change our fortunes      in this war. ,     "
ARWEN,"Renech i lu i erui govannen? (,) "
EOWYN,You should not doubt him.   
ELROND,I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is     failing.  As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes.  Arwen's life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has     come. 
SAM,"Hey! Come back now! Come back!There! What did I tell you?He's run off, the old villain.So much for his promises. "
ARWEN,It was a gift.Keep it. 
MERRY,To battle 
GOTHMOG,Get back there and smash it down! 
GOLLUM,Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home 
SOLDIER,"    Come on soldier, move it.  "
SAM,"No.  No you're not all right, you're exhausted.  It's that Gollum.  It's     this place.  It's that thing around your neck.  , I could help a bit.  I could carry it for     a while ,,     carry it for a while ,      I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share     the load  "
THEODEN,It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear     you as a burdon.  
GOLLUM," Lost!    , My Precious is lost. "
MERRY,Pippin.Let's go. 
GOLLUM,"Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? ,Caught in a web. Soon     you'll be eaten.  "
MORWEN,Listen to me. You must ride to Edorasand raise the alarm. Do you understand me?
ARWEN,Reforge the sword' ada. 
GANDALF,Let the Ringbearer decide 
FRODO ,No!Gandalf! 
ARAGORN, Haldir 
ARWEN,Tell me what you have seen. 
DENETHOR,This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not?     So mighty as man as he was. 
THEODEN,"Forth Eorlingas!,     "
GOLLUM,"Sneaking?  Sneaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.  Smeagol shows     them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak!'  Sneak?      Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice! "
THEODEN,I will say no more.  
GOLLUM,"A swamp, yes, yes.Come, master. We will take youon safe paths through the mist.Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. ,I found it. I did.The way through the marshes.Orcs don't use it.Orcs don't know it.They go around for miles and miles.Come quickly.Soft and quick as shadows we must be. "
FRODO,"Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol.     Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on. "
GIMLI,"Give me your name, horse-masterand I shall give you mine. "
FRODO,I'm so sorry Sam.     I'm so sorry.  
GOLLUM, Ech!  
SAM,Black Riders! 
ARAGORN,We must be quick. 
HAMA,Your staff 
THEODEN,Where are the riders from Snowbourn?   
FRODO,Sam! 
ELROND,She stays for you.She belongs with her people. 
THEODEN,"When last I looked......Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan. "
FARAMIR, Take cover!  Nazgul!  Fall     back.  Fall back to Minas Tirith!   
PIPPIN,"Gandalf, forgive me! "
GOLLUM,"And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of     the wind. We even forgot our own name.  "
SAM,Frodo! Come on! 
ARAGORN,Causeway!       
EOWYN,You are both honourable men.  
PIPPIN,Lets get another one! 
GANDALF,"Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls, kill the trolls! "
GANDALF,Your fingers would remember their old strength     better......if they grasped your sword. 
GIMLI,"Then we have run all this way for nothing?Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here......in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--?    ,I mean, charming......quite charming forest. "
PIPPIN,What about breakfast ? 
GOTHMOG,What of the wizard? 
MERRY,Quickly  
ARAGORN,"Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight?  They believe in     nothing.  They answer to no one "
SHAGRAT,  I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!      
ARMY,    DEATH!  
FRODO,We are bound to an errand of secrecy.Those that claim to oppose the enemywould do well not to hinder us. 
SAM,"He's trying to trick us.If we let him go, he'll throttle usin our sleep. "
SAURON,  My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome.      
FRODO,    I'm here Sam!  
ARWEN,You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? 
GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift 
GOLLUM,     My precious!  
PIPPIN,  Frodo!     
GIMLI,Come on. We can take them.        
MORWEN, Eothain!Freda! 
FRODO,  I can't!  I can't' I can't manage the Ring Sam.  It's' it's' such a weight to carry.  It's such a weight.         
PIPPIN,     Gandalf!  
ARAGORN,Go. 
MERRY, I want to fight! 
THEODEN,Hold them!       
FRODO,"So was l. ,     "
GIMLI,You'll find more cheer in a graveyard. 
TREEBEARD,It isn't safe.The trees have grown wildand dangerous.Anger festers in their hearts.Black are their thoughts.Strong is their hate.They will harm you if they can.There are too few of us now.Too few of us Ents left to manage them. 
GIMLI,"That one counts as mine! ,Stinking creature. "
PIPPIN,What are they saying ? 
FARAMIR," ,  It was     well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.     ,     You are to join the tower guard. "
ARAGORN,  I hold your oath fulfilled.  Go.  Be at peace.     
FRODO,I can't go back.  
ARAGORN,"Nan Barad! Nan Barad! , Haldir, nan Barad! ("
FARAMIR,I would not use the Ring.  Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and     I alone could save her.  
SARUMAN,Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva     notto-carinnar! 
GOLLUM,"Hurry, Hobbits.The Black Gate is very close. "
DENETHOR,You know nothing of this matter! 
LEGOLAS,"Le abdollen. ,You look terrible.    "
GIMLI,What's happening out there?       
GANDALF,Thank you.   
FRODO,  Sam!  Help me!      
GOLLUM,"Once they're dead. ,Ssssssssssssssh!           "
MERRY,Pippin! Hold on!           
GIMLI,"Aragorn!  ,      Let's find some food.   "
FRODO,"Don't hurt him! ,Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen     to me. "
SOLDIER,What?   
BOROMIR, So     it's true  
ARAGORN,There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago. 
ARAGORN,"Gentlemen, that's enough!  "
LEGOLAS,Nineteen!       
PIPPIN,"It's talking, Merry.The tree is talking. "
MERRY,"Yes Pippin, my point is, he's clearly over reacting! Run! "
FRODO,No Sam! Leave him alone!  
PIPPIN," well, yes.  At least well     enough for my own people.  But we have no songs for great halls and evil     times. "
THEODEN,"     I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed.      "
MERRY,I wouldn't count on it 
LEGOLAS,"Aragorn, nad no ennas "
SHAGRAT,  You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!     
THEODEN,"If I go, Theoden dies. "
FRODO,"I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol. "
BOROMIR,"One does not simply walk into Mordor.  Its black gates     are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep     and the great eye is ever watchful.  Tis a barren wasteland, riddled     with fire and ash and dust.  The very air you breathe is a poisonous     fume.  Not with ten thousand men could you do this.    ,It is folly "
GOLLUM,Because master did not ask. 
THEODEN,Where is Theodred? Where is my son?
FARAMIR,"So this is the answer to all the riddles. ,Here in the     Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call.,The Ring of Power within my     grasp.,A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor......to     show his quality. "
EOWYN,Ride with me!  
FRODO,"Victory was near. , But the     power of the Ring , could not be undone.  "
ARWEN,The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane.It is mine to give to whom I will.Like my heart.Go to sleep. 
SAM,"    Well, I'm back. "
THEODEN,"You have no power here ......Gandalf the ,. "
GANDALF,  No.  No it isn't.     
PIPPIN,The last of the Longbottom Leaf?  
KING OF THE DEAD,  Release us!      
TREEBEARD,There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods.But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things. 
FRODO,"Lead the way, Smeagol. "
GATEKEEPER,What do you want ? 
SAM,A shortcut to what ? 
TREEBEARD,"Go to sleep.Away with you. ,Come, the forest is waking up. "
TREEBEARD,"We have just agreed.,     "
GANDALF,"Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.  "
BOROMIR,"In a dream , I saw the Eastern sky grow dark ,In the West a pale light lingered A     voice was crying, your doom is near at hand , Isildur's bane is found    , Isildur's Bane "
BILBO," I'm not at     home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses. "
ORCS,"March, march!   March, march march!   "
GIMLI,  How?     
FRODO,Nothing.Just a dream. 
GOLLUM,"Hide, hide!   "
FRODO,"No! Don't look down, Sam!Just keep going! "
DENETHOR,"Yes, I wish that.   "
FARAMIR,"I would have done, but our numbers were too few. "
GIMLI,"  Bad idea!  Very handy in a tight spot these lads, despite the fact they're dead.     "
MERRY,Pippin! 
ORC,Let's put a maggot hole in your belly! 
FRODO,What are you talking about ? 
CROWD,For Gondor! 
FARAMIR,How many? 
SAM,You don't see it do you? He's a villain. 
ARWEN,Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. 
GANDALF,Darkness took me......and I strayed out of thoughtand time. 
FRODO,     Go Sam.  Now!      
GANDALF,"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria.  Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world  "
SAM,"Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo! "
MERRY,Yes!       
SAM,"Stop it! Leave him alone. ,Don't you understand? He's got to destroy     it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!  "
FRODO,Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone. 
PIPPIN,"Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die? "
GANDALF,It's the deep breath before the plunge.  
OLD MAN,Fire!       
GANDALF,"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to.       "
ARWEN,Why are you saying this? 
GOLLUM,Leave now......and never come back. 
FRODO,"The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For     five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave     it waited. ,     Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow     in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. , And     the Ring of Power perceived. ,     Its time had now come. , It abandoned Gollum.    , But something happened then     that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature     imaginable.  "
ARAGORN,Gondor calls for aid. 
ARAGORN,"You said you would bind yourself to     me,foresaking     the immortal life of your people "
ORC,We're not going no further......until we've had a breather. 
SAM,     Frodo!      
ARAGORN,Herio! 
FRODO,It is special. It's a little bit of home. 
GOLLUM,Come on! Must go! No time!  
SAM,"    You will not touch him again! , Come on then, finish it!  "
SARUMAN,The Horse-Men took your lands.They drove your people into the hillsto scratch a living off rocks. 
GIMLI,Tell me what happenedand I will ease your passing. 
GRIMA,Helm's Deep has one weakness.Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvertat its base...... which is little more than a drain. 
PIPPIN,Aaaaaaaagh! 
LEGOLAS,"  Thirty three, thirty four.     "
ARWEN,What's this ? a Ranger caught off his guard ?  
PIPPIN,    Alright!  
GIMLI,This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call     it a Mine!  
SAM,I thought they were dead. 
BILBO,Hobbits! Four hobbits!  What's more out of     The Shire by your talk!  What business brings you to Bree? 
GANDALF,"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.    ,  He is dead then.    ,  Its as I feared. "
GANDALF," Theoden King stands alone.,            "
GANDALF,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin. "
FRODO,"Don't worry Sam, Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one! "
MERRY,It's the trees. 
FRODO,We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down. 
GOLLUM,"Master. Master looks after us. ,Master wouldn't hurt us.           "
EOMER,"  Aim for the heads! ,     "
FARAMIR,This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.      You'll find cover in the woods there.     
EOMER,Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!           
FIGWIT,"Lady Arwen we cannot delay. , My lady! "
GIMLI,Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one!       
SAM,There's an eye-opener and no mistake 
DENETHOR,The rule of Gondor is mine and no others! 
SAM,    Mr Frodo? What is it?  
SAM,Where are you going?           
LEGOLAS,Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.  I fear war already     marches on their own lands.  
THEODEN,"Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!,     "
TREEBEARD,     
GOLLUM,"What's taters, precious?What's taters? Eh? "
FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened. 
GOLLUM,What? 
ARAGORN, Do not     disturb the water  
BILBO,"You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've     only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here,     oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart    ,     but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge     cake! , I can make     you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?        "
GOLLUM,Master should be resting.Master needs to keep up his strength. 
ROHAN HORSEMAN,Mordor will pay for this
GIMLI, Ah!      The walls of Moria! 
ARAGORN,Swords! Swords! 
GANDALF,The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.Sauron will suffer no rival.From the summit of Barad-durhis Eye watches ceaselessly.But he is not so mighty yetthat he is above fear.Doubt ever gnaws at him.The rumor has reached him.The heir of Numenor still lives. 
FARAMIR,Good speech. Nice and short. 
FRODO,I think we should get off the road. 
SAM,"    Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. , Wake up. Don't leave me here     alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead.     "
SAM,"Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?           "
BILBO,    Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before.  
FRODO,You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar. 
THEODEN,"I am ready, Gamling.Bring my horse. "
SAM,You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!  
PIPPIN,Merry! 
CAPTAIN,  Get back in the line you maggots!  Get back in the line you slugs!      
FARAMIR, Down there. 
GANDALF,Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here!     Return to your posts. 
GOLLUM,Give us that! Deagol my love  
GOLLUM,"Oh, yes, we could.Spoil a nice fish. ,Give it to us raw...    ,...and wriggling.You keep nasty chips. "
BILBO,"I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy    , I'm sorry that you must carry this     burden , I'm sorry for everything "
GIMLI,Never trust an elf 
SARUMAN,Gandalf the White.Gandalf the Fool!Does he seek to humble mewith his newfound piety? 
GANDALF,(looking back out to Mordor) All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...           
THEODEN,    DEATH!  
FRODO,  There will be none left for the return journey.      
PIPPIN,You've seen Frodo and Sam?   
SAM,"""Samwise the Brave.""     "
FRODO,"  Oh Sam, I'm so sorry.  Sorry for everything.     "
GOLLUM,"No!No! No, master!They catch you! They catch you!Don't take it to him.He wants the precious.Always he is looking for it.And the precious is wantingto go back to him.But we mustn't let him have it. "
GOLLUM,Aagh! 
SAM,    No!  
GANDALF,Mel..lon 
GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  "
THEODEN,"I know your face.,     Eowyn. Eowyn. ,Gandalf? "
GANDALF, Amon D'n. 
SAM, Saved     some for you Mr Frodo 
ARWEN,"Gwenwin in enninath...U-arnech in naeth i si celich. (,) Renech i beth i     pennen?  "
DENETHOR,Rohan has deserted us!  
GOTHMOG,The age of men is over.  The time of the Orc has come. 
BILBO,"Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a     few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old     as I am. "
MERRY,"Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.You're the short one. "
FARAMIR,And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored     look. 
FRODO,It began with the forging of the Great Rings.  
MERRY,A tree-herder.A shepherd of the forest. 
SAM,    What does he mean?  
MERRY, How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?  
FRODO,Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide.     Please......Iet me go down to him. 
SANDYMAN,Well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your     nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.  
MERRY,"Welcome, my lords to Isengard!  "
SAM,Strider!     Help him Strider! 
EOWYN,"Your son is badly wounded, my lord."
DENETHOR,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.  "
FARAMIR,  It's just the damp of the first spring rain.      
ARAGORN,Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. 
GIMLI,"It's true, you don't seemany Dwarf women.And in fact, they are so alikein voice and appearance......that they're often mistakenfor Dwarf men. "
SAM,"Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed! "
GIMLI,Oh! 
EOWYN,            
ARAGORN,Is there no other way?           
HOBBIT,"  Good     night, sweet maiden of the golden ale! "
FRODO,    Oooohhh! 
EOWYN,"West' Aragorn, hal "
BILBO,"Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger , Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome "
ARAGORN,One who will have your allegiance.  
SAM,You're a lying rat!  What did you do with it?   
GOTHMOG,Quiet.    
PIPPIN,"No, we won't. Not this time.       "
SAM,"Oh no, I'm not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread.  "
THEODEN,Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure      Saruman?       
ARAGORN, You're a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan.I do not think that would be your fate.  
GANDALF,The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden     King. 
GIMLI,  I guess that concludes negotiations.      
ARWEN," Your time     will come.  You will face the same evil and you will defeat it       A si i-Dh'ath '-orthor, Aragorn. ' or le a ' or nin. "
ARAGORN,Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
PIPPIN,My lord! 
FARAMIR,Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas      Morgul. You cannot go that way.           
PIPPIN,Did we lose him? I think we lost him. 
THEODEN,"Grima.Grima.,Grima."
EOWYN,Why should Merry be left behind?  He has as much cause to go to war as     you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves?   
GENERAL,  Oy!  I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!      
GOLLUM,Wraiths!Wraiths on wings!They are calling for it.They are calling for the precious. 
SAM,    Destroy it!  
GANDALF,"No! , Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!  "
THEODEN,"You must lead the peopleto Helm's Deep, and make haste. "
SAM,"That's it, then.We can't get past that. "
GANDALF,    Up! Quickly!  
ARAGORN,  No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of    Gorgoroth.  We can give him that.      
MERRY,Oh! I think I've broken something      
PEOPLE,"At last! Helm's DeepThere it is, Helm's Deep.We're safe! "
BOROMIR,Now get out of here! Get out! 
GIMLI,and I suppose you think you're the one to do it. 
LEGOLAS,The trees are speaking to each other. 
GANDALF,Come! 
GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you.       "
GANDALF,"      Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool.  ,  What can you see ?    , Can you see anything ? "
SOLDIER,Very good sir. 
BILBO,Gandalf?       
GOLLUM,We swears......to serve the master ...........of the precious. We will swear on.....on the preciousGollum. Gollum. 
SAURON,"Quiet, you!It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor'sgoing to hear this racket.    Let's just tie him up and leave him. "
ARAGORN,"The same blood flows in my veins , The same weakness  "
ELROND,"The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any     craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.      Only there can it be unmade.  It must be taken deep into Mordor and     cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came. ,One of you........... must do this "
MERRY,Aragorn! 
SAM,What we need is a few good taters. 
FRODO,Strider! 
SOLDIER,Double up men!  
PIPPIN, What     is going on ? 
GANDALF,"Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry! "
MORWEN,"Quickly! ,Go, child."
ARAGORN,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what     you seek.  
SAM,"Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo?It's a shame, really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope.    Well, there's nothing for it.It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry. "
SAM,Oi Mind who you're sweet talking! 
FRODO,Aiya E'rendil Elenion Ancalim'  
SAM,Backl you Devils!  
GOLLUM,"What's it doing?Stupid, fat Hobbit.It ruins it. "
PIPPIN,An act? 
THEODEN,"Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for. "
STRIDER,Into the wild 
FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r! 
THEODEN,"No!You must do this, for me. "
THEODEN,Retreat!        
SAM,"You'll make him sick, you will......behaving like that.    ,There's only one way to eata brace of coneys. "
PIPPIN,What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?    
SAM,"Come on, keep up.           "
ARAGORN, Frodo! Take     cover! 
FARAMIR,    Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to     Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will     strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. 
FRODO,"We've lingered here too long.Come on, Sam. "
GIMLI,Then what are we waiting for 
MERRY,"The belt! ,Run! "
SAM,"We have to get out of here.     You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put     it on. Disappear. "
FRODO,"Smeagol. , Master is here.     Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come. "
ARAGORN,He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has     saved them in the past. 
GANDALF,Oh really? 
GANDALF,"He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your     fathers. Westu h'l. Fer'u, Th'odred, Fer'u. "
GANDALF,"It reads ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend     and Enter"" "
STRIDER, You've     already had it 
SAM,This looks strangely familiar. 
ORC,"  Late as usual, pirate scum. ,  There's knifework here needs doing. Come on you sea rats, get off your ships.      "
ARWEN,Ae '-esteliach nad...     estelio han. Estelio ammen. 
SAM,"Hey,  what's in this tunnel?  ,      You listen to me!  You listen good and proper.  Anything happens to him,     you'll have me to answer to.   One sniff that something's not right, one     hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over.  No more slinker, no     more stinker.  ,  You're     gone.  Got it?  I'm watching you.   "
SOLDIER,"This is all we could save, my lady. "
ORC,The door wont give. It's too strong.  
LADY,"We're safe, my lady.Thank you. "
GIMLI,"You could have picked a better spot.,     "
FARAMIR,"Well, if you're not spies, then who are you? "
UGLUK,What is it? What do you smell? 
FARAMIR,There are no travelers in this land.Only servants of the Dark Tower. 
GOLLUM,Good Smeagol always helps. 
GANDALF,"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak!     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again. "
SAM,"  Oh no!  What do I do? ,  What do I do?      "
ELROND,Nothing is certain. 
ELROND,I looked into your future and I saw death. 
GOLLUM,"Dead?No, you cannot kill them. No. "
SARUMAN,"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End        "
STRIDER,Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall 
BILBO,A Ring!  
MERRY,"No no! the big one, big one! "
PIPPIN,Merry.       
PIPPIN, Yes.      
UGLUK,"Get back, scum!The prisoners go to Saruman.Alive and unspoiled. "
GOLLUM,"Yes, precious. False.They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!  "
MERRY,Trees that could whisper......talk to each other......even move. 
GOLLUM,They cursed us 
HALDIR,"A, Aragorn in D'nedain istannen le ammen. "
FRODO,"That was your name once, wasn't it?A long time ago. "
BOROMIR,They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.  
TREEBEARD,A hit. A fine hit.           
ARAGORN,"Havo dad, Legolas (,.) "
EOWYN,  I am no man!      
THEODEN,How many? 
DENETHOR, The     house of Stewards has failed.  
FRODO,You were not so very differentfrom a Hobbit once.Were you?Smeagol. 
SHAGRAT,    You get back you scum!  
GOLLUM,"Oh, cruel Hobbit.It does not care if we be hungry.Does not care if we should die. ,Not like master.Master cares.Master knows.Yes.Precious.Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go. "
GANDALF,Look at me.  
GOLLUM,"and cool, so nice for feet' and we only wish to catch a fish    , so juicy sweet.  "
MERRY,I'm fine. lt was just an act. 
ARAGORN,     I do not believe it.  I will not.     
ARAGORN,Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark? 
GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you.       "
TREEBEARD,Side?I am on nobody's side......because nobody's on my sidelittle Orc.Nobody cares for the woods anymore. 
PIPPIN,"But, we'll see each other soon? "
FRODO,"It betrayed Isildur ,to his death. ,And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.    ,History became legend, legend     became myth, , and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of     all knowledge. , Until, when chance came    , It     ensnared a new bearer.  "
GAMLING,We need more time to lay provisions-- 
GOLLUM,Yes. She could do it.           
THEODEN,"So much death. ,  What can Men do against such reckless hate?           "
ARAGORN,"Legolas, fire a warning shot past the boson's ear.  "
BILBO,Good gracious you have been productive! 
KING OF THE DEAD,The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep     it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die!     
EOWYN,A cage.To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them.And all chance of valor has gonebeyond recall or desire. 
GRIMA, He's     not welcome. 
URUK HAI,Then keep your mouth shut. 
EOWYN,His name is Brego. He     was my cousin's horse. 
PIPPIN,I get it. Don't be hasty.          
GANDALF,"    ,     Go back to the abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your     master!  "
FRODO,It's dark still.   
ARAGORN,"I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.It was a dream, Arwen.Nothing more. "
MERRY,They're close! 
DENETHOR,Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old.       Boromir would have remembered his father's need.   He would have brought me     a kingly gift 
ARWEN,"Why do you fear the past.  You are Isildur's heir, not     Isildur himself.  You are not bound to his fate "
TREEBEARD,Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years. 
SAM,The very highest.           
DENETHOR,"    Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. , Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must.  "
LEGOLAS, Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?   
SOLDIER,Watch out!           
PIPPIN,Merry! 
GIMLI,"Horse men!  I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and     filthy.   "
GATEKEEPER," alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful  "
SAM, Please. It's such a burden.     Will you not help him? 
MEN,Oh! 
EOWYN,Where is the rest? 
GORBAG,  I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!      
GAMLING,My lord! 
PIPPIN,Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.       
GANDALF,So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?       
SAM,"  Get off of me! ,  Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot!    ,  Get off of me!      "
LEGOLAS,That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheatedby some spell. 
THEODEN,Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow?    
FRODO,What?  That's all we have left!   
ELROND,"But you, my daughter......you will linger on in darknessand in doubt......as nightfall in winterthat comes without a star.Here you will dwell......bound to your griefunder the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your lifeare utterly spent. "
ARAGORN,How long do you need?       
SNAGA,"Yeah!Why can't we have some meat?! ,What about them?They're fresh. "
SOLDIER,"We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.   "
DENETHOR,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be     retaken.   
SAM,"    , You don't mean that. You can't     leave. "
MERRY AND PIPPIN, 
GANDALF,No!  
ORC,"  Move it, you slugs!      "
GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril "
ARAGORN,  Not for ourselves.  But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.   Keep him blind to all else that moves.      
FRODO,"It was in this moment, ,that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.  "
BOROMIR,"We cannot stay here! ,This will be the death of the     hobbits! "
THEODEN,Rohan     is mine. 
ARAGORN,Dago hon! Dago hon! 
MERRY,You remember the Old Foreston the borders of Buckland?Folk used to say there was something inthe water that made the trees grow tall......and come alive. 
SAM,"Mr Frodo ? , Frodo! Frodo!     , I thought I'd lost you "
THEODEN,Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc.  
PIPPIN,Are we lost ? 
MERRY and PIPPIN,"Oh you can search far and wide, You can drink the whole town dry    ,     But you'll never find a beer so brown, But you'll never find a beer so     brown,     As the one we drink in our hometown, As the one we drink in our hometown.    ,You can drink your fancy ales, You can drink them by the flagon             But the only brew for the brave and true,     "
ARWEN, Estelio guru l'n ne dagor.     Ethelithach. 
DENETHOR,"    I release you from my service. ,Go now and die and what way seems best to you.  "
UGLUK,They are not for eating. 
GIMLI, Nooooo!     NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo! 
SAM, No! 
BILBO," My my     old ring.  Well I should... very much like to hold it again, one last     time.  "
FARAMIR,"Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me.   "
EOMER,None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil.   
ARAGORN,Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.
GANDALF,"It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old     who would believe it. ,     You haven't aged a day!  "
ARAGORN," F'ste, stille n',     f'ste, stille n'. Lac is drefed, gefr'gon. "
GRIMA,"There were threewho followed the wizard.An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man. "
GOLLUM,The rock and pool    Is nice and cool    So juicy sweet    Our only wish    To catch a fish    So juicy sweet 
GANDALF,Stars wheeled overhead......and every day was as longas a life age of the Earth.But it was not the end.I felt life in me again. 
DENETHOR,"Theoden's betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS! ,FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES! "
PIPPIN,"Merry!No, Treebeard said that youshouldn't have any. "
ORC,"Catapults! , ha ha ha.     "
WHITE WIZARD,You are tracking the footstepsof two young Hobbits. 
GOLLUM,'Murderer' they called us. They cursed us and drove us away.    
GOLLUM,Go away. 
SAURON, Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?     
EOWYN,"Take heart Merry. , It will soon be over "
SAM,No!  Mr Frodo 
GANDALF,"Gandalf? ,Yes.That was what they used to call me.Gandalf the Grey.That was my name."
GOLLUM,Not anymore. 
EOMER,"The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level's in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.  "
ARAGORN,Ten thousand strong at least. 
SAM,  Stand up Mr Frodo.  Stand up!     
LEGOLAS," It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.   "
FRODO,"What are we holding on to, Sam?           "
STRIDER, Dartho     guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon. 
GIMLI,Last one standing wins heh heh heh! 
FARAMIR,ls that its name?           
FRODO,  It's so heavy!      
EOWYN,  It grows so cold.     
GOLLUM,Follow me.           
GOLLUM,Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.  
ARAGORN,"Togo hon dad, Legolas! , "
GANDALF,He's been following us for three days 
MERRY,What are you doing? 
DENETHOR,My line has ended!  
GRISHNAKH,"Alive? ,Why alive?Do they give good sport? "
FRODO,Sam! We're still in The Shire.  What could possibly     happen! 
ROHAN HORSEMAN,"My Lord Eomer, over here!"
TREEBEARD,"I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not      Orcs.,     "
ARAGORN,It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men.     They will be here by nightfall. 
ARAGORN,You will not enter Gondor 
SAM,Mr. Frodo?           
SAM,Who are they? 
GOLLUM,Come master.   
EOMER,I am sorry. 
ARAGORN,You cannot give me this 
LEGOLAS,Aragorn!       
GOLLUM,Deagol!  
GRIMA,"I've only......ever served you, my lord.     "
GANDALF,The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.           
PIPPIN,Give me it back. Merry! 
GOLLUM,Deagol!  
SAM,Nothing.  Just clearing something up.  
PIPPIN,Done! 
PIPPIN,"It's perfect. One barrel each.,Wait.      Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?           "
FRODO,"Ah aah! Its sticky, what is it?  "
FRODO,    You swore! You swore on the precious!  
MERRY,Saruman's storeroom!           
GALADRIEL,"And you Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of E'rendil, our most beloved star. , May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.  "
GOLLUM,Go away? 
FRODO,It's because we've been here before.We're going in circles. 
GORBAG,"  Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine!     "
GRIMA,Why do you lay these troubleson an already troubled mind?Can you not see?Your uncle is weariedby your malcontent......your warmongering.
GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him 
ARAGORN,All lsengard is emptied. 
WILDMAN,Murderers!
URUK HAI,Man-flesh 
PIPPIN,"For the Shire.  Hold him, hold him down Merry!     "

BILBO,"     Sackville-Bagginses! ,     Quickly! Hide! "
BILBO,"Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to     remember.       "
GOLLUM,"It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious.     "
THEODEN,  More will come     
MERRY,I want some! 
GIMLI,The air is so close in here. 
TREEBEARD,They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.       
THEODEN,To the gate. Draw your swords!       
DAMROD,Nazg'l! 
GIMLI,What are you doing? What are you stopping for?       
PIPPIN,Where are we going? 
PIPPIN,You've got my arm... argh!... you've got my arm 
EOMER,"Not alone. , Rohirrim!           "
EOMER,We left none alive.We piled the carcasses and burned them.  
GRIMA,"A just question, my liege. ,Late is the hour......in which this     conjurer chooses to appear., Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest. "
GOLLUM,Over here.  
SAM,Look Frodo.  It's Mr Bilbo's trolls 
MERRY,He's gone. 
GAFFER,"There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, others of a     less than savoury nature  "
SAM,"Come on, Frodo. Come on! "
PIPPIN," We are sitting on a field of     victory enjoying a few well earned comforts , The salted pork is particularly good.  "
URUK HAI,Can't take his draught! 
SAM,"And I've gone and had too much. , It must be getting late.  "
PIPPIN,I had the loveliest dream last night.There was this large barrelfull of pipe-weed.And we smoked all of it.And then......you were sick.I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby. 
SOLDIERS ON GATE,"    Come on, come on!  "
MERRY,"Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.           "
FARAMIR,What did they steal? 
PIPPIN,Is he going to die ? 
GANDALF,"    Farewell my brave Hobbits. , My work is now finished.    ,Here at last, on the     shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. , I will not say do not weep for not all     tears are an evil. , It is time Frodo.     "
SHAGRAT,  Stop your squealing you dunghill rat!      
GIMLI,"heh heh heh , what did I say? He can't hold his liquor.  "
NOAKES," War's brewing.    , The mountains are fair teeming with     goblins. "
GANDALF,"Hmmm ,You     would not part an old man from his walking stick."
GIMLI,Edoras?That is no short distance! 
FRODO,What?           
GANDALF,What?  
FRODO,Strider 
UGLUK,I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.Saruman will have his prize.We will deliver them. 
FRODO,What did he say? 
ARAGORN,They must be warned! 
ELROND, There are those that dwell in the mountain.   
FARAMIR,He's here. 
PIPPIN,ARGH! 
GIMLI,It's all right. Nobody panic.That was deliberate.It was deliberate. 
GIMLI,"No, I couldn'tI really couldn't. "
MERRY,"Here, something for the road.  "
GANDALF,Hope is kindled!   
THEODEN,I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man. 
PROUDFOOT HOBBIT, PROUDFEET!  
TREEBEARD,South? But that will lead you past lsengard.       
ELROND,"They will answer to the King of Gondor.  , And'ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of     Narsil.   "
DENETHOR,Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead. 
MERRY,You're taller. 
SARUMAN,Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess' the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D'r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!  
SAM,Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.  
ARWEN,But it is not lost. 
WITCH KING,Slay them all! 
THEODEN,Brace the gate!       
GIMLI,You young rascals. A merry hunt you've led us on and now we find you     feasting and ' and smoking!  
SOLDIER,Make way!       
ARAGORN,Out!  
MERRY,"Hasty? Our friends are out there. ,They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.       "
FRODO,Go! 
EOMER,To the king!           
DEAGOL,Why?  
GOLLUM,"No, no birdses to eat.No crunchable birdses.We are famished! Yes!Famished we are, precious!  "
GALADRIEL,"I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston     ned 'wilith.                     "
HAMA,Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you     need. 
MERRY,"I'm ready!  , Sorry.  It isn't all that dangerous.  It's not     even sharp.   "
GOLLUM,"Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry.  "
UGLUK,Let's move! 
PIPPIN,"  Well, , that's not  so bad.     "
GANDALF,Bring them down!  
ARAGORN,King Theoden has a good memory.He was only a small child at the time. 
EOWYN,"  Merry! ,     "
SAURON, And who is this?  Isildur's heir?  It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.      
GOLLUM,"No! , There's another way.More secret. A dark way. "
FRODO,The Ring is treacherous.It will hold you to your word. 
BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to.       "
GOLLUM,Master betrayed us.  
SARUMAN,This night......the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan!March to Helm's Deep!Leave none alive! 
GRIMA,"Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the     darkness ,......in     the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The     walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing     in.    ,So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging     to winter's chill. "
LEGOLAS,"Govannas v'n gwennen le, Haldir o L'rien. "
BILBO,Where's it gone?       
SOLDIER,Down to the lower levels quick!  
LEGOLAS, Forty-three.           
THEODEN,"  Re-form the line!  Re-form the line!,     "
THEODEN, Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!         
GANDALF,So be it 
FRODO,What food have we got left? 
GIMLI,"He was twitching......because he's got my axe ,embedded in his nervous system!           "
GIMLI,"Strong?! ,Oh, that's good. "
THEODEN,Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.           
EOWYN,"My lord, your son......he is dead. , My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do     nothing? "
PIPPIN,Gandalf? 
SAM,"Mr. Frodo?It's the Ring, isn't it? "
FRODO,"Sam, no! "
THEODEN,Dark have been my dreams of late. 
SAM,"    , There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale     by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished     it. "
PIPPIN,  Frodo!      Merry! Its Frodo Baggins! 
GANDALF,No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared!  
PIPPIN,"Yes. Exactly.,If we go south, we can slip      past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.      It's the last thing he'll expect.       "
SARUMAN,We have work to do 
BOROMIR,Legolas!  
GIMLI,Where?  
STRIDER," These are for you.      Keep them close, I'm going to have a look round,  Stay here    "
ARAGORN,"It will not be our end, but his.   "
HALDIR,Aragorn!  
GANDALF,"There never was much hope.  Just a fool's hope.  , Our enemy is ready.      His full strength's gathered.   Not only orcs, but men as well    ,  Legions of Haradrim from     the South, mercenaries from the coast ,     All will answer Mordor's call.  "
FRODO, I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor. 
GALADRIEL,If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous     road 
THEODEN,Let them come! 
GANDALF,"    Volley! , Fire!  "
URUK HAI,Why?You want some? 
EOWYN,     I will kill you if you touch him.     
HOBBIT,    Hey watch the pumpkin. 
WITCH KING,  Do not come between the Nazg'l and his prey.     
GOTHMOG,    Fire at will!  
MERRY,"Excuse me!  , I have     a sword.  Please accept it!  , I offer you my service Theoden King. "
MERRY,"Only, , you've never done a hard day's work.     "
PIPPIN,lt is!           
GANDALF,Hobbits!  
FRODO,"This is Sting.You've seen it before......haven't you, Gollum?Release him or I'll cut your throat. "
SAM,What is that ? 
DENETHOR,Perhaps you come to explain this.  
GANDALF,You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.  
SAM,"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer.And it's the one placewe're trying to get to.It's just where we can't get.    Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way. "
THEODEN,    DEATH!  
SAM,  Mr Frodo!      
GOLLUM,I hate you.I hate you. 
ARWEN,There is still hope. 
ORC,  Come on!  Faster!      
BILBO,"    Oh, pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time.  "
GANDALF,No. 
DENETHOR,"Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you     cast a poor reflection on me. "
MERRY,"Good luck trying to find something decent around here. ,Probably only dead rats and      mouldy bread.,     "
ARAGORN,"    Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in     your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come     when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all     bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered     shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day!     This day we fight!  "
GOLLUM,We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears. 
SAM,Wait! We're innocent travelers! 
GOLLUM,We lead them to the winding stair. 
SAM,  I don't think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo.      
FRODO,"I have to destroy it Smeagol. , I have to destroy it for both our sakes.  "
SOLDIER,Hold!  Hold them!   
FARAMIR,"Mithrandir!  ,     They broke through our defences.  They've taken the bridge and the West     bank.  Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.   "
BOROMIR,"Good, very good.  "
ARAGORN,They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to     destroy its people......down to the last child. 
SAM,  We did it Mr Frodo.  We made it to Mordor.      
SARUMAN,"Hobbits have been living and farming in the four     Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. , quite content to     ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. , Middle Earth being,     after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of     little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted     amongst the very wise.  "
THEODEN,Grima'. Come down! Be free of him!  
ARWEN,and to that I hold.  I would rather share one lifetime     with you than face all the ages of this world alone  
MADRIL,"Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. , Theoden's people have fled     to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on     the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the     Black Gate. "
PIPPIN,"Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us.      What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.,     "
FRODO,You've been there before? 
GANDALF,You did not kill me......you     will not kill him. 
PIPPIN,     I didn't think it would end this way.   
FRODO,Stop it!   
GANDALF,"No, we need him alive. We need him to talk.  "
SAM,"Do you want to know      what happened to Boromir? ,You want to know why your brother died?  He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! ,He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!           "
LEGOLAS,This forest is old.Very old.Full of memory......and anger. 
GOLLUM,Yes. 
EOMER,  Nooooo!      
ARAGORN,'-bedin o gurth ne dagor. 
MERRY,Ssh!As soon as they find out we don'twe're dead. 
PIPPIN,I'm hungry 
FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected.       "
GANDALF,Into the Mines! 
DENETHOR,"Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses, and they are few.     We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a     meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored     that the weapon of the enemy has been found.   "
SAM,"You can't save him, Mr. Frodo. "
ARAGORN,Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli.  
EOWYN,"  Take the reins, pull him left. ,  LEFT! ,     "
GOLLUM,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious? "
GIMLI,"Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a     dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.  "
DAMROD,"Go,  come on! "
BILBO,Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday!     
GRIMA,Ah!  
SAM," Oh my!   I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it to go so far.  I was just     so, so angry!  Here just' let's just rest a bit. "
FARAMIR,Hurry.       
GOLLUM,"NO! , Aaaaaaaaa. "
BILBO," Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.  "
ARAGORN, Andelu i ven. 
ARAGORN,Merry! 
GANDALF,Saruman'.. your staff is broken!  
GRISHNAK,You're lateOur master grows impatient.He wants the Shire-rats now. 
FRODO,    Aragorn!  
GOLLUM,No! 
FRODO,Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.       
GANDALF, Foreseen and done nothing!   
THEODEN,Make haste across the Riddermark.  Summon every able-bodied man to     Dunharrow.   
MERRY,And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?       
MERRY,Hello Frodo! 
GANDALF,Shadowfax.He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friendthrough many dangers. 
DEAGOL,"Oh Smeagol Ive got one! , Ive got a fish Smeagol, Smeagol!    "
URUK HAI,"Sick, is he?Give him some medicine, boys! "
MERRY,Isengard? 
SAM,    Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! 
ARAGORN,Gandalf. 
GALADRIEL,    The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of     men.  
MERRY,Why is that? 
GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door.       "
TREEBEARD,They're always trying to get somewhere where they....       
ELROND,Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It     waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Und'miel.  
BILBO,"The 22nd day of September in the year 1400    ,by Shire     reckoning. , Bag End,     Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.    , The Third Age of this world.  "
ARAGORN,"Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. "
EOMER,"What business does an Elf, a Manand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?Speak quickly! "
DENETHOR,"You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his     quality. I think not. ,I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not     fail me. "
BOROMIR, as you wish! I care not  
ARAGORN," Boromir!    ,     Give the Ring to Frodo  "
GOLLUM,"Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.           "
FARAMIR," Prepare to leave.    ,The Ring will go to Gondor.    "
FARAMIR,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.   
EOWYN,Do you not know? 
GIMLI,Fangorn?What madness drove them in there?
ARWEN,But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. 
PIPPIN,  What?  Gandalf?  See what?     
LEGOLAS, Hiro hyn h'dh'     ab 'wanath...  
FRODO,     Excuse me. That man in the corner.  Who is he ? 
LEGOLAS,Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?        
ARAGORN,Man cenich? 
SAM,Spies? Now wait just a minute. 
PIPPIN,Who? 
FRODO,"    Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must     come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no     more journeys for him. , save one.  "
ORC,    Killed another one has she?  
FARAMIR,"As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me. "
GENERAL SHOUT,Lets drink to Victory! To Victory! 
LEGOLAS,The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard.
FRODO,What's that smell. 
GOTHMOG,    Move into the city. Kill all in your path.  
ORC,Come here! 
FARAMIR,It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.   
ROSIE,Good Night lads 
FRODO,Now! 
GALADRIEL,"You cannot hide!  , I see you!    ,There     is no life in the void , Only death! "
STRIDER,To Rivendell Master Gamgee.  To the House of Elrond.     
PIPPIN,The White Wizard? 
SARUMAN,"Together, my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth. "
GOLLUM,"Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel. "
MERRY,Dunno why he's so upset!  Its only a couple of carrots 
GOLLUM, My precious.  
GANDALF,Faramir?  This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path. 
LEGOLAS,I'm on 17!       
ARAGORN,Brego!  
TREEBEARD,"Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come.,Now we must decide if the Ents......will     go to war. "
ARWEN,I choose a mortal life 
GIMLI, Hmmmm 
TREEBEARD,"Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.You might call it far, perhaps.My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain.I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.And safe is where I'll keep you.I believe you will enjoy this next one too. ,It's one of my own compositions.Right."
STRIDER,A little more caution from you!  That is no trinket     you carry! 
GOLLUM,"The thieves............... The thieves.The filthy little thieves.Where is it?.............Where is it?They stole it from us.............My precious.........Curse them, we hates them!It's ours, it is, and we wants it! "
GOLLUM,Leave now and never come back! 
ARAGORN,This belongs to you. 
DENETHOR,Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born? 
PIPPIN,Frodo! 
FRODO,Go home.   
FARMER MAGGOT,"Hoi! You get back here! Wait till I get this through you!     , Get out of my fields! You'll know the devil if I catch     up with you! "
THEODEN,     Eowyn.      
GIMLI,I'm wasted on cross-country.We Dwarves are natural sprinters.Very dangerous over short distances.
SAM,"Because.Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.There's naught left in himbut lies and deceit.It's the Ring he wants.It's all he cares about. "
DENETHOR,"My son!  ,  Leave me!  "
SOLDIER,Boromir! Boromir! 
FRODO,    We were home.  
ARAGORN,Minl' pendich nin i aur     hen telitha. 
TREEBEARD,"The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.,     "
MERRY,"Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all.           "
DENETHOR,"     I am steward of the house of An'rion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep.  "
EOMER, Forward!   
ARAGORN,Leithio i philinn! 
PIPPIN,"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper!  He knows about them, doesnt he ? "
ARAGORN,He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must     turn back! 
PIPPIN,Leave him alone! 
WILDMAN,We will die for Saruman.
SAM,Why haven't you spoken of this before? 
GAMLING,Make way for the king.Make way for Theoden.Make way for the king. 
PIPPIN,I didn't think they would find any livery that would  fit me.  
TREEBEARD,"That doesn't make sense to me.      But then......you are very small. ,Perhaps you're right. South it is, then.      Hold on, little Shirelings. ,I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.,     "
FRODO,"Nothing ever dampens your spiritsdoes it, Sam? "
MERRY,Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? 
ARAGORN, My lord Elrond 
EOWYN,I can fight. 
ARAGORN,Brego. 
MERRY,You must help. Please. You must do something.       
FRODO,"  It's too late.  It's over.  They've taken it Sam,  they took the Ring!      "
EOWYN,Lord Aragorn......where is he? 
GIMLI,"Forward. I mean, charge forward. "
GANDALF,And then the pass of Cirith Ungol. 
FARAMIR,"I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. ,     "
GANDALF,Owwwh!  
FRODO,We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've     arrived? 
SAM,Yes you will.  Of course you will.  That's just morbid thinking.  We're     going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.  You'll see. 
GANDALF,Ridiculous Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel!  
ARAGORN,A Hobbit lay here.And the other. 
GANDALF,In the common tongue it says
SARUMAN,Rip them all down  
FARAMIR,"They're not coming from the North!  To the river quick, quick! "
GIMLI,And no regurgitation! 
MERRY,Get the rope Sam 
FRODO,"He didn't mean for a lot of thingsto happen, Sam......but they did. "
ARAGORN,"I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.This is Gimli, son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden, your king. "
FRODO,      What are you doing ? 
SAM, Does she ? 
GORBAG,     The scum tried to knife me.  Kill him!      
STRIDER,Kingsfoil 
SAM,  And the Shire!     
GANDALF,Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? 
FRODO,Gollum! 
MERRY,Did you hear that?There it is again.Something's not right here.Not right at all. 
ARWEN,Si peliannen i v'd na dail l'n. Si boe '-dhannathach. 
FRODO,    I'm sorry uncle. I'm afraid I lost it.  
MERRY,Aaagh!  
FRODO," I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but....,I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it     on......he'll find me. He'll see. "
ARAGORN,"In one thing you have not changeddear friend.,You still speak in riddles.     "
SOLDIER,Mordor has come.       
PIPPIN,It was your idea! 
BOROMIR,"and if we fail what then ? , What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ? "
FRODO,"    How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in     your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some     things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken     hold. "
ORC,"  Come along you scum! ,  I'll whip you down to the bone!  Come on!  What have I told you.    ,  Get up!    ,  Come on you slugs!  You two are going straight to the front line!  Move it, come on!  Fall in!  Move it! Move it! Move it!      "
FRODO,"I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. "
GOLLUM,Look.Look. See what Smeagol finds? 
GAMLING,What is it? Hama? 
ARAGORN," Mae carnen, Brego,     mellon n'n. "
BILBO,"My old sword, Sting , Here, take it, take it. "
ARAGORN,The Mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as Bill. 
GOLLUM,Quick! They will see us!They will see us! 
MERRY,"I think we might have made a mistakeleaving the Shire, Pippin. "
GOLLUM,Come to Smeagol. 
MERRY,Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin     
GANDALF,"Hold them back, do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight!  "
ARAGORN, I have wished you joy since first I saw you.  
GIMLI,"This, in turn, has given riseto the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring outof holes in the ground... "
FRODO,Gollum! 
ARWEN,Nach gwannatha sin? 
FARAMIR,Speak. 
SAM,Let him     go!  Or I'll have you Longshanks! 
DENETHOR,"What you judged to be right!  You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in     the hands of a witless Halfling!  It should have been brought back to the     citadel to be kept safe. Hidden.  Dark and deep in the vaults' not to be     used.  ,      unless, at the uttermost end of need. "
GOLLUM,Whats it doing? 
BOROMIR,We make for the gap of Rohan.  We should never have     come here 
GIMLI,"Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the     dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone! "
GANDALF,"Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him     news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention     Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if     you don't speak at all Peregrin Took.  "
ARAGORN,The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! 
SAM,"Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.      They kept going......because they were holding on to something.    "
GANDALF,"  We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed.    Tell your master this.  The armies of Mordor must disband.  He is to depart these lands, never to return.      "
THEODEN,"And gladly, I accept it.  ,      You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.  "
GOLLUM,Yes. There's a path......and some stairs.And then......a tunnel. 
ARAGORN,"    My friends, , you bow to     no-one.  "
MERRY,OK.  Want a tomato Sam ? 
MERRY,Yes?       
SARUMAN,"So you have come here for information. I have some for you.    ,Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.     ,     You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.  "
SAM,"  Frodo, get down! ,  Hide!      "
GANDALF,    You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground. 
GOLLUM,You're a liar and a thief.  
LEGOLAS,So' it's a drinking game? 
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Gandalf! Gandalf!       
STRIDER,Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.  
SARUMAN,Tens of thousands. 
PIPPIN,"  Merry! ,  Merry it's me.    ,  It's Pippin!      "
UGLUK,They have something.An Elvish weapon.The master wants it for the war. 
GANDALF," I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and     orcs "
TREEBEARD,Away with you.You should not be waking.Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. 
GOLLUM,Yes. Yes. Yes.           
GOLLUM,The secret stair.  Climb. 
DENETHOR,      Boromir was loyal to me!   Not some wizard's pupil. 
THEODEN,It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. 
FRODO,What did you say? 
FRODO,He said your life was a sad story. 
GIMLI,Talking trees.What do trees have to talk about?Except the consistencyof squirrel droppings. 
EOMER,     You should not encourage him. 
GANDALF,"Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste. "
BOROMIR , No! No! 
GOLLUM,No time to lose silly!  
PIPPIN, It's so quiet.   
GANDALF,"Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done.  Another     opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.     , You must not fail me.      "
FRODO,What was that about?   
GOLLUM,No. Not its business. Leave us alone! 
SAM,Mr. Frodo? 
HALDIR,"Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. "
ARAGORN,"  Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! ,  Let justice be done upon him!      "
GANDALF,"Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst     ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be     destroyed "
GANDALF,"Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.     ,      The one who will lead Mordor's army in war.  , The one they say no living man can kill.    ,     The Witch King of Angmar. You've met him before.  ,      He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. ,     He is the lord of the Nazg'l.  The greatest of the nine. "
SAM,    Yes Mr Frodo. It's over now. 
PIPPIN,"I don't want to be in a battle.  But waiting on the edge of one I can't     escape is even worse. , Is     there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?   "
SAM,  And that's for my old gaffer!     
GALADRIEL,Moria... you fear to go into those mines. 
GRIMA,"No, from the North.One of the Dunedain RangersI thought he was.His cloth was poor.And yet he bore a strange ringTwo serpents with emerald eyes.. One devouringthe other crowned with golden flowers. "
FRODO,Smeagol?           
SARUMAN,Send out your Warg-riders. 
SARUMAN,To war! 
EOWYN,So few. So few of you have returned. 
WOMAN,They're past the door!           
BOROMIR," One moment of peace, can he not give us that? "
FARAMIR,"Then it is forfeit. Release them.,     "
ROHIRRIM,"  Cut him down! ,     "
MERRY,How can that be your decision?!        
MERRY,I don't know! I don't know whats going to happen. 
GANDALF,"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.    Go back to the Shadow.The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Udun!"
MERRY,  I knew you'd find me.     
LEGOLAS, Goblins!  
FRODO,"Ha! , What are you     doing! "
GANDALF,I've no memory of this place 
GOLLUM,"They are young.They are tender. They are nice.Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!    "
GIMLI,Keep breathing. That's the key.Breathe. 
GANDALF,Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone. 
THEODEN,Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. 
THEODEN,  Rally to me!  To meeee!      
GOLLUM,"    Clever Hobbits to climb so high! ,Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the     precious! "
GOLLUM,Save me?           
LEGOLAS,"Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!"
PIPPIN,"Run, Merry! "
SAM,It's no more than you deserve! 
SARUMAN,"Rohan, my lord......is ready to fall."
GANDALF,  I've sent him to his death.      
ARAGORN,But never more than memory. 
ARAGORN,You have some skill with a blade. 
HAMA,By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of     Helm's Deep. 
ROHIRRIM,Aye!  
PIPPIN,Merry!Merry! 
GANDALF,"Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor     however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. "
ARAGORN,Dolen i v'd o nin. 
GANDALF,      Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back to the second level. Get the     women and children out. Get them out. Retreat.  
GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?      
BILBO,"    Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand     years. "
FARAMIR,It will grieve you then to     learn that he is dead. 
GOLLUM,No!That would kill us! Kill us! 
SARUMAN,Sauron.  Lord of the Earth 
MERRY," But you're part of this world!      Aren't you?!,     "
TREEBEARD,"Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.       "
GANDALF,"Let me risk a little more light , Behold the     great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. "
GOLLUM,See?  See?  He wants it for himself.   
EOWYN,To battle 
SARUMAN,"You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I? "
SAM,  Not if I stick you first!      
SOLDIERS IN MINAS TIRITH,Its Mithrandir!  The White Rider!   
PIPPIN,"Well, I'm taller than you were then.  Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways.   "
BILBO,"Oh! Thankyou my boy You're a good lad Frodo. I'm very     selfish you know. , Yes,     I am.  Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother     and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of     all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.     "
EOMER,    Flank ready! 
EOWYN,Sssh 
PIPPIN,What's that ? 
LEGOLAS, Have you     heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed 
GIMLI,  Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care?     
PIPPIN,  Ooh!  that was     close!  
HALDIR,Nan Barad! (To the Keep!)       
FRODO,    Not quite. There's room for a little more.  
SAM,Bogs and ropeand goodness knows what.It's not natural. None of it. 
ARAGORN,It cannot be. 
GOLLUM,Master's my friend. 
ARAGORN,"I am asleep.,This is a dream. "
ARAGORN,This army.  
GIMLI,What is it? What do you see?  
ORC,The trees are strong my Lord.  The roots go deep 
PEOPLE,Hail! 
SAM,It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places     where there is still teatime. 
GANDALF,Hearken to me! I release you......from the spell.    
ARAGORN,    Et E'rello Endorenna ut'lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!     
FRODO," Underhill, my name's     Underhill "
PIPPIN,Merry!Merry! 
GAMLING,Into the Keep!       
GANDALF,I am Gandalf the White.And I come back to you now......at the turn of the tide. 
GANDALF," Fool of a     Took!  ,  Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your     stupidity!  "
GANDALF,Minas Tirith. City of Kings.  
GOLLUM,To make his war.The last war that will coverall the world in Shadow. 
ARAGORN,Boe ammen veriad l'n. Andelu i ven! 
ARAGORN,"Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich? (,) "
STRIDER,Andelu i ven.  
MERRY,"The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.      And.... ,And all that was once green and good      in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.       "
SAURON,"  The Halfling was dear to thee I see.  Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.  Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?  And he did Gandalf, he did.      "
ARWEN, O man pedich?    
FRODO,"No Sam!  It's you!  ,      I'm sorry Sam.   "
SAM,BuBye Bill 
SAM,You never know. 
TREEBEARD,"And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.        "
BOROMIR,"You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. "
SAM,Frodo! 
MERRY,Pippin! 
ARAGORN,Gimli!       
FRODO,Excuse me ?  
SAM,"Mr Frodo, look!  The King has got a crown again.   "
DENETHOR,That will depend on the manner of your return.   
SARUMAN,There will be no dawn for Men.  
GRIMA,That is a lie.Saruman the White has ever beenour friend and ally.
GRIMA,His staff. I     told you to take the wizard's staff. 
GOLLUM,My name.My name.Smeagol. 
FARAMIR,My men tell me that you are Orc spies. 
PIPPIN,Frodo! Come on! 
THEODEN,As long as you can give me.       
FARAMIR,  I do not believe this darkness will endure.      
GOLLUM,Sneaking. 
GANDALF,He's very fond of you. 
GIMLI,But there were two Hobbits.Did you see two Hobbits with them? 
THEODEN,Follow me! 
GIMLI,"Yes!,     "
GANDALF,And what did you tell him? Speak! 
FRODO,    The last pages are for you Sam.  
THEODEN,I want every man and strong     lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall.    
THEODEN,Hold them! Stand firm!       
PIPPIN,"I saw' I saw him! , I     could hear his voice in my head. "
DENETHOR,They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly. 
FARAMIR,He would have kept it for his own.  And when he returned you would not     have known your son.  
GOLLUM,"See? See?We've led you out.Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you.    ,Nice Hobbit. "
FRODO,Get off the road! Quick! 
PIPPIN,They think we have the Ring. 
EOMER,"Hasufel! Arod! ,May these horses bear you to betterfortune than their former masters.,Farewell."
GOLLUM,Murderer) 
FARAMIR,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong.   "
KING OF THE DEAD,Who enters my domain? 
FRODO,"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler. "
ARAGORN,He's not alone.Sam went with him. 
GOLLUM,My Precious!  
SAM,    Give me your hand.  
BOROMIR, Who are you ? 
ARAGORN,Move your feet 
FRODO,"One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the     power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. , A last     alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the     slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.  "
PIPPIN,It comes in pints ? 
MERRY,"This my friend, is a pint!  "
SOLDIER,"    Hurry along there, hurry along. "
MERRY,Where are they going?       
FRODO,Sam. He'll be here.  He'll come. 
GRIMA,Send me not from your sight. 
HALDIR,"We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark     days. "
FRODO,What are they ? 
GANDALF,You will tell him wont you? 
PIPPIN,Look! The trees! They're moving!       
MERRY," Hello, Pip. "
PIPPIN,Well that's nice! That's nice!  Ash on my tomatoes! 
FRODO,Dead? How? When? 
LEGOLAS,  A diversion.      
PIPPIN,"    AAAAhhh! ,  "
ARWEN,Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?  
GOLLUM,"Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. ,We ought to wring his filthy little neck.,Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! ,And then we take the precious......and we be the master!           "
GALADRIEL,"This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a     way, no one will.  "
ARAGORN,"You cannot wield it.  None of us can    , The One Ring     answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master "
EOWYN,There.  A true esquire of Rohan.   
GIMLI,Agh!  Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who     still draws breath. 
THEODEN,"Get them into the caves. , Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can     reach us here. "
GOLLUM,"We could let , do it.           "
PIPPIN,Merry! 
FREDA,Where is Mama? 
DENETHOR,Would you deny your own father? 
BILBO," No thank     you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!     "
FARAMIR,"Fall back!  ,  Retreat!  Retreat!  Run for your lives!   "
FRODO,"I have to leave the Shire. ,Sam and I must get to Bree "
BOROMIR,"He loves you, Father. "
SARUMAN,Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! 
PIPPIN,"Please, Merry.You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7"". ,3'8""! "
DENETHOR,"    No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. , Bring wood and oil.  "
GATEKEEPER,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war. "
EOWYN,I have heard of the magic of Elves......but I did not look for it in a     Ranger from the North.You speak as one of their own. 
ELROND,Leithio i philinn!  
BOROMIR," Aye it is a     gift! ,A gift to the foes of     Mordor. Why not use this Ring ? , Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept     the forces of Mordor at bey.  By the ,of our people are     your lands kept safe.  Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy, let us use     it against him   "
LEGOLAS,Final count.....42.           
LEGOLAS,and heir to the throne of Gondor 
GOLLUM,"Wake up! , Wake up!     ,Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once.  "
THEODEN,I take my leave.  
LEGOLAS," We must move on,     we cannot linger. "
SAM,It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp. 
DENETHOR,"    The house of his spirit crumbles., He is burning. Already burning.  "
GRIMA,I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now     that your brother has deserted you. 
MERRY," Exactly.      , Bar-hrum.     "
EOMER,"I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.      "
SAM,"That's a filthy lie!  ,      You stinking, two faced sneak!   "

BILBO,Aaaaah.  
FRODO,Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ? 
SHAGRAT,    She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa' then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower!  
LEGOLAS, Faeg i-varv d'n na lanc a      nu ranc.

GOLLUM,"Yes. , No! No! ,It's too risky. It's too risky.           "
ARAGORN,What?       
UGLUK,They've picked up our trail. 
ARAGORN,These are strange tracks. 
THEODEN,No parent should have to bury their child. 
GANDALF,It's Saruman! 
FRODO,"He's led us this far, Sam. "
SAM,You've had a whole half already! 
SARUMAN,Get down cur! 
BOROMIR,"This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty     and music. And so it shall be once more! ,Let the armies of Mordor know this:     Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.    ,This city of Osgiliath has been     reclaimed ,for     Gondor! "

GOLLUM,"Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! "
BILBO,"Yes, yes. "
GIMLI, Don't tell the Elf.       
EOWYN,Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on     the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.   
THEODEN,We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast     must reach the end with the strength to fight.  
SAM,The journey home.  
SAM,"I do. ,It's the Ring.You can't take your eyes off it.I've seen you.You're not eating. You barely sleep. ,It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it. "
GOLLUM,No. 
FARAMIR,You must come with me. Now.

TREEBEARD,There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.       
FRODO,"Three were given to the elves. ,Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.    , Seven to the     dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.    ,And nine, nine rings were     gifted to the race of men. , Who above all else, desire power.  "
FRODO,Are you saying there's another wayinto Mordor? 
FRODO,"It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.            "
MERRY,"Mmmm , Green Dragon!  "
FRODO,"If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us. "
GANDALF,Is it secret ? Is it safe ? 
LEGOLAS,I mistook you for Saruman. 
FRODO,"There was no other.    ,We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two     were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn,     son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor. "
GANDALF,"The Grey Pilgrim.     That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked     this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in     vain. ,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to     the east. "
ARAGORN,Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
PIPPIN,My friend is sick.He needs water. Please! 
EOWYN, Make for the lower ground! 
DENETHOR,"And I shall not forget it! ,  nor fail to reward  that which is given.     ,      Fealty with love.  ,      Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.      ,      I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences     that your brother long held intact.   "
GIMLI,    Aaaahh!  
LEGOLAS,"Your friends are with you, Aragorn.       "
ARAGORN,"    This day does not belong to one man, but to all. Let us together rebuild     this world, that we may share in the days of peace.  "
MERRY,Pippin!

FRODO,"Put it out you fools! , Put it out! "
PIPPIN,Yes!           
FRODO,I carry nothing 
PIPPIN,What's happening?! 
SAM,So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.           
SAM,You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! 
ARAGORN,Do not let him speak.He will put a spell on us. 
MERRY,Follow me. Run! 
GIMLI,"  There's plenty for the both of us, may be best Dwarf win!      "
PIPPIN,I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again. 
ELROND,Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.  
SAM,No one at home will believe this. 
GANDALF,  Silence!     
GOLLUM,Master! 
FRODO,"I know what I have to do, Sam.The Ring was entrusted to me.It's my task.Mine! My own! "
THEODEN,Give them a volley.       
THEODEN,"Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.,     "
ARMY,    DEATH!  
GIMLI,Stand you traitors!  
ARAGORN,    For Frodo.  
BILBO,I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it     matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. 
SAM,"Oh, save us.My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now. "
MERRY,Than me! 
FRODO,    Gandalf?        
MERRY,Come on! 
MERRY,"Longbottom Leaf. ,The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.           "
THEODEN,They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!       
GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!  "
GANDALF,"Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us."
FREDA,"I don't want to leave.I don't want to go, Mama."
FRODO,"You have no idea what it did to him......what it's still doing to him.,I want to help him, Sam. "
ELROND,If Aragorn survives this waryou will still be parted.If Sauron is defeatedand Aragorn made king......and all that you hope forcomes true......you will still have to tastethe bitterness of mortality. 
GOLLUM,Hurry! This way. 
FRODO, We will go through     the Mines 
ARAGORN,...into Fangorn Forest. 
PIPPIN,We've had one yes.  What about second breakfast ? 
FRODO,Mordor! 
STRIDER,"  He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.    , This is beyond my skill to heal.  He needs     elvish medicine  "
THEODEN, They will be 300     leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want     of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk     open war. 
FARAMIR,"In Ithilien.  Not two days ago.  Gandalf, they're taking the road to the     Morgul vale.   "
SAM,"Hey, stinker, don't go gettingtoo far ahead. "
MERRY,You never can! 
SOLDIER,Follow me to the barricade.       
SAM, But where     is he leading us ? 
FARAMIR,It's been very quiet across the river.   
MERRY,  Are you going to leave me?     
HALDIR," The dwarf     breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. "
FRODO,Come on!  
GOLLUM,Hide! Hide! 
STRIDER, You have a     stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you.  You can no     longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming 
SAM,    Back!  
PIPPIN,Steady on! 
GIMLI," If     anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say     that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the     Mines of Moria.  My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.  "
WITCH KING,    You have failed! The world of men will fall.  
MERRY,Who is she? 
SAM,What? 
MERRY,Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to     be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here. 
THEODEN,There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate. 
PIPPIN, Mushrooms!      
LEGOLAS,Game over! 
SARUMAN,Free? He will never be free! 
LEGOLAS,"The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice , The eye of the enemy     is moving. "
GIMLI,The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.  
GANDALF,"  End?  No, the journey doesn't end here.  Death is just another path, one that we all must take.    ,  The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass.  And then you see it.     "
PIPPIN,"    He's not dead. HE'S NOT DEAD , NO! NO! He's not dead.  "
BOROMIR,"The shards of Narsil ,  The blade that cut the Ring from     Sauron's hand , Ah! ,Its still sharp , but no more than a broken heirloom    "
GANDALF,Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have     not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless     worm.  
WOMAN,They are breaking in!           
TREEBEARD,Break the dam!  Release the river!           
STRIDER,Frodo Frodo 
GANDALF,I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. 
DENETHOR,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?   
PIPPIN,     Merry!       
GOLLUM,Not that way! 
PIPPIN, Aragorn. 
GIMLI,Oh! 
GANDALF,Where?  When? 
GOTHMOG,Kill him. 
PIPPIN,You're hurt. 
TREEBEARD,'Tis a gathering. 
FRODO, Yes 
THEODEN,"Eomer.,     "
BOROMIR,"Gondor has     no King. , Gondor needs no King  "
EOMER,Prepare to move out!  
ARAGORN,Aaaaagh! 
BOROMIR,You are no elf 
GANDALF,It was more than mere chance thatbrought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.A great power has been sleeping herefor many long years.The coming of Merry and Pippinwill be like the falling of small stones......that starts an avalanchein the mountains. 
GIMLI,I would stay still if I were you. 
SOLDIER,Watch our backs!       
MERRY,     Pippin! 
GANDALF,I've been sent back...... until my task is done. 
SAM,"Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.            "
PIPPIN," ,   "
GANDALF,"Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen. "
ORC,  Break it up!  Break it up!     
PIPPIN,"So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.  ,  I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any     fighting,   do they?   "
GANDALF,"There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which     I will not utter here.  "
WILDMAN,We will fight for you.
BILBO,"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing. "
GAMLING,Fall back!       
ARAGORN,They crawled. Their hands were bound. 
PIPPIN,  Frodo!     
SAM,He's up to something. 
ARAGORN,Gandalf.           
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!       
LEGOLAS,There is a fell voice on the air 
GIMLI,"Oh! , That's     it, right, we warned you! Prepare to be boarded!  "
SOLDIER, Hail to you sire!   
DENETHOR," It's dangerous,     I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But     you, you are strong.    And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people     who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will     return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go.    ,Bring me back this     mighty gift    ."
FARAMIR,What would you have me do? 
ARAGORN,Pippin! 
MERRY,    DEEEEAAATH! 
FRODO,Yes.  For my part. 
ARAGORN,Men of the South are welcome here 
GANDALF,"Oh it's quite simple.  If you are a friend, you speak     the password and the doors will open ,     Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (     "
SAM,It's six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!  
ARWEN,He's fading  
ARAGORN,Pull! 
SAM,No. 
SAM,Mr. Frodo! It's all right.I'm here. 
MERRY,and these 
FARAMIR,"His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was     cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart.    ,He was my brother. "
FRODO,"Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him, I do pity him. "
SOLDIER,Throw another one over here!    
GOLLUM,"Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in!  "
SAM,Come on faster! 
GIMLI,"Did they hit anything?,     "
EOWYN,"Leave me alone, snake! "
SAM,Can you see the bottom? 
LEGOLAS,Orcs! 
GOLLUM,They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead 
ELROND,Arwen. 
SAM,    AAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhh! 
MERRY,Pippin! 
EOMER,Look for your friends.But do not trust to hope.It has forsaken these lands. We ride north! 
BILBO,"No. Well yes, b b b but thats not the point. The point is,     Frodo, , You'll be     alright.  "
TREEBEARD,I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north      to your homeland from there.       
GIMLI,"Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.       "
FRODO,  Sam!      
EOMER,They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.   
FRODO,"I can't do this, Sam.           "
BILBO,"Yes Yes , Made by the elves you know.  The blade glows blue     when orcs are close and its times like that my lad, when you have to be     extra careful.    Here's a pretty thing. , Mithril!    ,     as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales.  Let me see you put     it on, go on. "
PIPPIN,Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children? 
GIMLI, I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!      
GOLLUM,"What does it eats?Is it tasty? ,It tries to chokes us!We can't eats Hobbit food!We must starve!     "
ARAGORN,Hide!  
GIMLI, That's it! Go on! 
SHAGRAT,"    No. , This fellow ain't dead. "
MERRY, What are     they eating when they can't get hobbit ? 
GIMLI, Stay close young     hobbits.
SAM,That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we     arrived!  
EOMER,  We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.      
GOLLUM,"What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve? "
FRODO,Aagh! 
GIMLI,Orc blood. 
SAM,  Begging your pardon but they haven't.     
FRODO,Where are you taking us ? 
GANDALF,"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.    "
GRIMA,"     My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe. "
GIMLI,They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will     defend them if not their king? 
GOLLUM,Filthy little     Hobbitses! They stole it from us! 
GANDALF,     Left. 
ARAGORN,Where are they? 
FRODO,Who then do I trust ? 
MERRY,We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits! 
EYE OF SAURON,"    Aragorn! ,     Elessar!  "
PIPPIN,"No, it isn't. I'm starving.           "
GOLLUM,"Quick, quick!  They will see, they will see! "
MERRY,Hold these 
MERRY,What was that! 
THEODEN,Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down.  
ARAGORN,"    By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the     West! "
FARAMIR," Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.,     "
THEODEN,"(    Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our     enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--? ,No, my Lord     Aragorn......we are alone. ,Get the women and children     into the caves. "
TREEBEARD,Die? No.We lost them.And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire? 
GIMLI,"Heh heh heh heh ,Here, here. , Raaar it's the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women haha  "
GAMLING,"What of those who cannot fight, my lord?The women and children? "
GANDALF,    Stay this madness!  
SOLDIER,"What's happening, where is he going?  I don't understand.  (, Lord Aragorn!  Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?   "
GOLLUM,No. Not master.  
PIPPIN,I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father     will see it.   
BILBO,"Oh right. ,     You don't mind if I do, do you?  "
THEODEN,Then she was left aloneto tend her king in growing fear.Doomed to wait upon an old manwho should have loved her as a father. 
MERRY,"Can't say that I have. You, Pip? "
SAM,Why? 
HALDIR,"     You bring great evil with you ,You     can go no further! "
GANDALF, Oh it's useless 
MERRY,Frodo! 
FARAMIR,What news? 
SAM,Don't you lose him Samwise Gamgee and I don't mean to.  
GOLLUM,Careful master!  Careful.   Very far to fall.  Very dangerous are the     stairs.   
GOLLUM, We must go now? 
FRODO,"Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth     was defeated. , The Ring passed to Isildur.    , Who had this one chance to destroy evil     forever. , But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.    ,     And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.  "
THEODEN,    Forth Eorlingas!  
FRODO,But I know you have something to do with it.       
MERRY,You're supposed to stick it in the ground     
ARAGORN,Get back! and     stay close to Gandalf. 
ARAGORN,They ran over here. They were followed  
GOTHMOG,"Grond will breach it! , Bring out the wolf's head. "
SAM,"Fine, have it your own way.  ,  I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be     moving on.  "
SAM,Athelas ?  
GIMLI,You might as well accept it.  We're going with you laddie.  Aragorn     smiles. 
GOLLUM,What did you call me? 
LEGOLAS,"Come on, Gimli! "
ARAGORN,  Draw out Sauron's armies.  Empty his lands.   Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.      
MERRY, Thank you! I win! 
FRODO,He's been true to his word. 
SARUMAN,The Forest of Fangornlies on our doorstep. Burn it.
FRODO,    To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place     on the last ship to leave Middle Earth.  
PIPPIN,Run! 
TREEBEARD,"Treebeard, some call me. "
SAM,"We're not going to wait for you. Come on.,     "
ORCS,"Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond,     Grond! "
PIPPIN,I'm getting one! 
BOROMIR,The One Ring. lsildur's     Bane. 
MERRY,No! 
GOLLUM,Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false. 
ARAGORN,"Thank you. ,It's good."
TREEBEARD,"We Ents have not troubled......about the wars of Men and     wizards......for a very long time. But now, something is about to     happen......that has not happened......for an age.,Entmoot. "
EOWYN,"To the smithy, go!   "
ARAGORN,     Pull back! Pull back!       
MERRY,Saruman. 
SAM,"Shut up you!  ,  Go away!  Get     out of here! "
SAM,Mr.     Frodo.... 
GANDALF,Look at me! What did you see?  
LEGOLAS,Aragorn! 
FRODO,      Good Night Sam  
GOTHMOG,    FIRE! 
SAM,"    ,  We're going that way, straight as we can.  There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need.      "

BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good. "
