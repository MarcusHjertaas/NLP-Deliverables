GOLLUM,But we swore to serve the masterof the precious. 
BILBO,    I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.  
GANDALF, Gwaihir go! Gwaihir 
PIPPIN, What do they     look like? 
PIPPIN,And whose side are you on? 
SOLDIER 2,Will Rohan's army come?  Mithrandir? 
GANDALF,Bilbo Baggins.  
ARAGORN,Tangado a chadad! 
SAM,    Nooooooo! 
PIPPIN,"I'm sorry, Treebeard.       "
ELROND,"  You ride to war     but not to victory.  Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.      But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be     in the city in two days.  You're outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men. "
ELROND,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army     more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become     who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.  
SAM,    Frodo!  
VOICE,Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! 
LEGOLAS,The White Wizard approaches. 
MERRY,What! 
THEODEN,Time is against us. Make ready! 
FRODO,You will lead us to the Black Gate. 
FRODO,Sam!  
BOROMIR,We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and     take the west road to my city! 
EOMER,Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps.
GANDALF,Helm's Deep. 
ARWEN,"From the ashes of fire shall be woken,     A light from the shadow shall spring,     Renewed shall be blade that was broken,         The crownless again shall be king. "
BILBO,"There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo     Baggins. ,Now, where to begin?     Ah, yes. ,Concerning Hobbits.  "
LEGOLAS,"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to     the last King of Gondor , to come to his aid, to fight. But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the     North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the     Paths of the Dead.  "
MERRY,Hello?Treebeard?Where has he gone? 
GRIMA,"You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund."
SAM,He took it.  He must have.  
GOLLUM,"It wasn't us. It wasn't us. ,Smeagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it.  "
GIMLI,Dead? 
THEODEN,Timbers! Brace the gate!       
SAM,"Well, starve, then. And good riddance! "
BARLIMAN,"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are.      Wandering the wilds.  What his right name is, I've never heard, but     round here, he's known as Strider. "
GANDALF,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. "
SAM,"Oh alright, but we don't have that much left. We have to be careful or     we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I've rationed     it, there should be enough.  "
GANDALF,"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward. "
GANDALF,    Steady! Steady!  
THEODEN,  
ARAGORN,The beacons of Minas Tirith!  The beacons are lit!   
SAM,What are you doing?            
ARAGORN,    Hold your ground! Hold your ground!  
GANDALF,"  Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.     "
SAM,"  Look!  The Orcs, they're moving off!      "
GANDALF,"Sauron fears you, Aragorn.He fears what you may become.And so he'll strike hard and fastat the world of Men.He will use his puppet Sarumanto destroy Rohan.War is coming.Rohan must defend itselfand therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.    ,The king's mind is enslavedit's an old device of Saruman's.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest. "
LEGOLAS,He is here! 
GANDALF,"We come to it at last.  ,The great battle of our time.   "
WITCH KING,     Feast on his flesh.     
BILBO,"    Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you? "
ARWEN,"Then it is a good dream. ,Sleep. "
GOLLUM,"But they knows, ,     they knows, they suspects us! "
SAM,"Get off him! ,     Frodo, are you alright? "
LEGOLAS,I see shapes of men and of horses. 
FRODO,Smeagol?           
SAM,"    , Not dead.  "
SAM,"What is it, Mr. Frodo? "
PIPPIN, Frodo! 
FRODO,"Your coming to us , is as the footsteps of doom.     You bring great evil here! ,Ringbearer! "
SAM,I don't believe you! 
DENETHOR,    Set a fire in our flesh!  
GIMLI,"Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.,     "
GANDALF,"     It's only a matter of time.  He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.     "
TREEBEARD,"Hold on, little Hobbits.           "
PIPPIN,What're you going to do then ? 
SAM,"  Mr Frodo, look. ,  There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch.      "
FRODO,Smeagol? (shouts) SMEAGOL! SMEAGOL!  
SARUMAN,We have only to remove thosewho oppose us.It will begin in Rohan.Too long have these peasantsstood against you.But no more.
WITCH KING,  You fool!  No man can kill me.  Die now!    
SAM,"Boil them, mash themstick them in a stew.Lovely, big, golden chipswith a nice piece of fried fish.  "
THEODEN,Make haste. We ride through the night.  
IROLAS,They were outnumbered! None survived.  
THEODEN,    DEATH!  
GOLLUM,"Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. , Smeagol will show you the way.           "
FARAMIR, Tell the men to break cover.  We ride for Minas Tirith. 
EOMER,"No pauses, , no spills. "
DENETHOR,"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?  Come, sing me a song.      "
SAM,  Let's get you out of here.      
SARUMAN,A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires!  
GANDALF,"This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.    Here the hammer stroke     will fall hardest.  ,  If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath     falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.  "
STRIDER,Sam! Do you know the Athelas plant ? 
BILBO,"    Tell me again lad, where are we going? "
LEGOLAS,The horses are restless and the men are quiet. 
ARAGORN, Tell the women and children      to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!           
PIPPIN,    Hmm?  
ARAGORN,Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
GOLLUM,It burns!It burns us!It freezes!Nasty Elves twisted it. 
STRIDER,You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill! 
ORC,  Company halt!  Inspection!      
SAM,Mr. Frodo.Look.It's an oliphaunt.  
ARWEN,"Gerich veleth n'n, ada. "
SAM,"  We have to go in there Mr Frodo.  There's nothing for it. ,  Come on let's just make it down the hill for starters.      "
SAM,No! 
ARAGORN,Frodo!  
PIPPIN,Can I have some bacon? 
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Hooooraaaay!        
GANDALF,We have just passed into the realm of Gondor. 
GANDALF,Courage is the best defence that you have now.   
MERRY,It can't be.           
LEGOLAS,"     Fifteen, sixteen.  "
EOWYN,Women of this country learned long ago:Those without swordscan still die upon them.I fear neither death nor pain. 
ARAGORN,Their bonds were cut. 
THEODEN,So it begins.       
FRODO,What do you mean ?  
ARAGORN,Who are you?Show yourself! 
PIPPIN,A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard     day's work.  
FRODO,What happened to her? 
FRODO,Because I have to believehe can come back. 
SAM,Po-ta-toes. 
SAM,  Come on Mr Frodo.  We'd best find you some clothes.  You can't go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin.      
FRODO,Smeagol? 
ELROND,I will not leave my daughter hereto die. 
GIMLI,This new Gandalf's more grumpythan the old one. 
ARWEN,"This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship     now that can bear me hence. "
THEODEN,"  I know your face, Eowyn. ,  My eyes darken.     "
GIMLI,This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is     thick and their shields broad. 
GIMLI,We failed them. 
SARUMAN,"The Ring of Barahir.So Gandalf Greyhamethinks he has found lsildur's heir.The lost king of Gondor.He is a fool.The line was broken years ago. ,It matters not.The world of Men shall fall.It will begin at Edoras. "
ARWEN,I don't believe you.  
ARAGORN,"  Long have you hunted me.  Long have I eluded you.  No more! ,  Behold, the Sword of Elendil!      "
SAM,Those rain clouds might. 
PIPPIN,"Don't talk to it, Merry.Don't encourage it! "
GAMLING,"Make way! ( ,We cannot hold much longer!       "
BILBO,"Frodo, the door! ,     sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!  "
FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance 
PIPPIN,    NO! NO!  
WITCH KING,Send forth all legions.  Do not stop the attack until the city is     taken.   
GAMLING,Wargs! 
ARAGORN, What does your     heart tell you? 
GANDALF,Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here.     
MERRY,Help him! 
GANDALF,One stage of your journey is over.Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed. 
FARAMIR, Boromir would not have brought the Ring.   He would have stretched     out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.   
GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad "
ARWEN,It is mine to give to whom I will.  Like my heart     
ELROND,     I Aear c'n ven na mar.  
GIMLI," The dead?     Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. , Very good. Very good. , Legolas!  "
GIMLI,Salted pork'  
FRODO,I'm not sending him away. 
SAM,     Frodo! 
FARAMIR,No.   
THEODEN,"  Bring it down! Bring it down!  Bring it down!,     "
PIPPIN,  Merry!     
HAMA,"I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf     Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue. "
EOMER,You have no authority here.Your orders mean nothing.
GANDALF,Peregrin Took. I'll take that my lad! Quickly now!  
FRODO,Sam. My dear Sam. 
SAM,Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing?      
ARAGORN,"I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.    ,What say you?     "
GRIMA,No!  
SOLDIER 1,Where are Theoden's riders? 
GENERAL,  Move along scum!      
GOLLUM,    Smeagol lied!      
DENETHOR,Can you sing Master Hobbit? 
SOLDIER,Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. 
GANDALF,From the lowest dungeonto the highest peak...... I fought with the Balrogof Morgoth. 
GIMLI,"...which is, of course, ridiculous. "
ARAGORN,Their pace has quickened.They must have caught our scent.Hurry! 
PIPPIN,"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt.  "
EOWYN,My lord? 
BOROMIR, Aragorn! This.. is Isildur's heir 
KING OF THE DEAD,The dead do not suffer the living to pass.  
EOMER,Theodred.Find the king's son!
GANDALF,Yes. 
SAM,It's just something Gandalf said.  
PIPPIN,"uhh huh , I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon.  "
GOLLUM,No. No. 
FRODO,  There are so many of them.  We'll never get through unseen.      
FRODO,    It's been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It's never really     healed.  
BARLIMAN,"Gandalf ?  ,Gandalf ? Oh yes!  I remember!  Elderly chap! Big grey     beard, pointy hat.  , Not seen     him for six months.  "
SARUMAN,"Build a dam, block the streamwork the furnaces night and day."
SAM, I'll kill him! 
ARAGORN, '-chebin Estel anim.   
FRODO,     Better than it was 
TREEBEARD,Tree?I am no tree!I am an Ent. 
GANDALF,Pippin. 
ROHAN STABLEMAN,"That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him. "
SOLDIER,Hold fast the gate!       
ARAGORN,"No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been     spilt on his account. "
GIMLI,Let's hope they last the night.       
HOBBIT,Happy Birthday! 
MORWEN,Eothain! Eothain!You take your sister.You'll go faster with just two.
TREEBEARD,"You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over.      Go back to your home.,     "
FRODO,"    We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me.  "
LEGOLAS,"    What about side by side with a friend? ,  "
GANDALF,Fool of a Took!  
ARAGORN,Do you ride with us? 
ARAGORN,Not a word. 
BOROMIR,They have a cave troll! 
THEODEN, Gamling.   
ARAGORN,Tracks lead away from the battle... 
FRODO," Nothing.     There's nothing , Wait. There are     markings ,  Its some form of Elvish.  I can't     read it "
GRIMA,Get out of my way! 
FRODO,Sam! 
SAM,Mr. Frodo!Are you all right? 
SNAGA,Just a mouthful......a bit of the flank. 
PIPPIN,Get down! 
SOLDIER,The beacon!  The beacon of Amon D'n is lit.   
ARAGORN,"It has been remade. ,     Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? ,What say you? "
GOLLUM,No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead! 
ARAGORN,"  Oh, I think he will.      "
LEGOLAS,Crebain! From Dudland! 
EOWYN,Then you must be at least 60. 
SOLDIER,Look! Osgiliath burns!       
SAM,There are dead things!Dead faces in the water. 
SARUMAN,The power of Isengard is at your command 
PIPPIN,The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by     many. 
FRODO,Oh Sam!  
BOROMIR,and what would a     ranger know of this matter ? 
SHAGRAT,    What's this?  
LEGOLAS,Forgive me. 
EOMER,"  Drive them to the river. ,     "
SAURON,  Aha!  Old Greybeard!  I have a token I was bidden to show thee.      
SAM,"    , Frodo! "
SARUMAN,The world is changing.Who now has the strength to standagainst the armies of Isengard......and Mordor?To stand against the might of Sauronand Saruman......and the union of the two towers?
ARAGORN,"Brego. 'in nama is cynglic. (,) "
SAM,"I know. It's all wrong.      ,By rights, we shouldn't even be here.      But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.      ,Full of darkness and danger they were.      And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy?       How could the world go back      to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?           "
MERRY,It's Saruman's army.The war has started.
GANDALF,"Guard of the Citadel indeed! , Now back up the hill     quickly. Quick!  "
GANDALF,"Fight them back! ,Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel. "
FRODO,"    My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. , You will     have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be     and to do. Your part in the story will go on.  "
ELROND,Our time here is ending.Arwen's time is ending.Let her go.Let her take the ship into the west.Let her bear away her love for youto the Undying Lands.There it will be ever green. 
MERRY,    Frodo!  
GANDALF,"I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound."
PIPPIN,What is it? 
SAM,Call me' 
KING OF THE DEAD,None but the King of Gondor may command me!  
FRODO,"The Ring will not save Gondor.      , It has only the power to destroy.      Please......Iet me go.        "
FRODO, I'm all right.   
GOLLUM,And take it for Meee! 
GANDALF,Get up! 
MERRY,Put it back! 
GIMLI,"Well!  Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I     have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!  "
GIMLI,Bring your pretty face to my axe. 
EOTHAIN,"Yes, Mama."
PIPPIN,Merry! 
GIMLI,Aragorn!       
GOLLUM,      Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.           
LEGOLAS,A scout! 
DENETHOR,"    You may triumph in the field of battle for a day, but against the power that     has risen in the east, there is no victory!  "
GOLLUM,Master must go inside the tunnel.  
GANDALF,"  Frodo has passed beyond my sight. ,  The darkness is deepening.      "
THEODEN,"Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.,Now it shall cover the grave    of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and     the old linger. That I should live......to see the last days of my house. "
MERRY,No 
STRIDER, She died.    
EOWYN,    Courage Merry. Courage for our friends.  
PIPPIN,Mordor. 
LEGOLAS,Why doesn't that surprise me! 
BOROMIR,Its moving fast.... against the wind 
WITCH KING,"    Do you not know death when you see it, old man? , This is my hour!     "
FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.  
BILBO,What's this?  
FRODO,Now that I'm here I don't think I want to.  
MERRY,"It's good. Definitely from the Shire. ,Longbottom leaf eh?  "
GOLLUM,We must get the precious! We must get it back! 
FRODO,"No, it isn't. It isn't midday yet. , The days are growing darker.  "
GANDALF,Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have     one of those on our tail. 
ARAGORN,They would be small.Only children to your eyes. 
SAM,"Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir.           "
MERRY,"     The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles. "
PIPPIN,It is in the ground  
EOWYN,You are one of the Dunedain.A descendant of Numenorblessed with long life.It was said that your racehad passed into legend. 
BOROMIR,For Gondor! 
SAM,"    Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry     it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!  "
FRODO,It's getting heavier. 
GANDALF,"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden,     King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King     Theoden is now very strong. "
GIMLI,He fell. 
SAM,What's to ruin? There's hardly any meaton them.  
ARAGORN,They will hold. 
MERRY,What's that? 
GOLLUM,Yes......on the precious.....On the precious. 
SAM,"Get down! I said, down! "
SAURON,I see you! 
MERRY and PIPPIN,Help! 
FRODO,Get away! 
SARUMAN,The Old World will burnin the fires of industry.The forests will fall.A new order will rise.We will drive the machine of warwith the sword and the spear...... and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only     to remove those who oppose us. 
PIPPIN,He needs medicine my lord!  
FRODO,    Smeagol promised!  
MERRY,What?  It was just a detour. A shortcut 
ARAGORN,I was raised in Rivendell......for a time.Turn this fellow free. He's     seen enough of war. 
FRODO,Gandalf! 
ARAGORN,Haldir!       
GANDALF,Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's counsel. Tell us what you know!  
PIPPIN,There's no more stars!  Is it time?   
GOLLUM,"Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.           "
FARAMIR, You're a friend of Boromir? 
EOMER,These Orcs are not from Mordor.
TREEBEARD,"The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. ,Young trees. Wild trees.  "
TREEBEARD,Hooom! 
PIPPIN,     Thanks  
EOWYN,We need you here.   
DENETHOR,"lt has fallen into the hands of     the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot     let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor. "
MORWEN," Freda, I will find     you there."
GRISHNAKH,What about their legs?They don't need those. 
FRODO,Speech! 
FRODO,It's a riddle!  
GAMLING,To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.   
GOLLUM,The Dead City!  Very nasty place full of enemies. 
FRODO,Bilbo! Bilbo!  Watch out for the dragon     
SOLDIER,We need 10 more.   
GANDALF,You're in the service of the steward now.  You'll have to do as you are     told Peregrin Took. 
THEODEN,Hail the victorious dead 
SAM,"Mr. Frodo, no. "
GIMLI,..and are never seen again 
ARWEN,"If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time. "
GANDALF,Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known! 
FRODO,"  It's Him, the Eye!     "
SOLDIER,Captain? 
FARAMIR,Father?  
GIMLI, I will be     dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf 
GIMLI,"If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it! Let     us go through the Mines of Moria "
ORC,But nothing can breach it!  
FRODO,If you scare him off then we are lost! 
TREEBEARD,"Sleep, little Shirelings.Heed no nightly noise.Sleep till morning light.I have business in the forest.There are many to call.Many that must come. ,The Shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all woodsis drawing near."
FRODO,We wish to at the Inn.  Our business is our own. 
THEODEN,All riders to the head of the column. 
ARAGORN,It's a long way.       
STRIDER,"Indeed , I can avoid being seen if I wish.      But to disappear entirely     That is a rare gift! "
SAM,"    Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards     will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He     is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,     (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the     strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?  "
GRIMA,This order does not come from me.It comes from the king.He signed it this morning.
ARWEN,I have made my choice. 
GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men."
SAM,Ssh.. be quiet 
BILBO,"My dear Bagginses and Boffins, , Tooks and Brandybucks ,, Grubbs ,, Chubbs    ,, Hornblowers ,, Bulgers ,,     Bracegirdles ,, and Proudfoots "
TREEBEARD,"Hobbits?Never heard of a Hobbit before.Sounds like Orc mischief to me! ,They come with fire.They come with axes.Gnawing, biting, breakinghacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! "
